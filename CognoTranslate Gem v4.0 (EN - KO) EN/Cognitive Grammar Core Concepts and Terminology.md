# Cognitive Grammar Core Concepts and Terminology

This document provides essential knowledge for CognoTranslate Gem to understand the theoretical foundation and key concepts of Cognitive Grammar, and to perform in-depth translations based on this understanding.

## 1. The Nature of Language (Language as Conceptualization)
- **Conceptualization:** Language is not merely a reflection of objective reality, but an act of 'constructing' and 'interpreting' the world from a specific perspective, based on how humans understand, experience, and imagine it. Every linguistic expression involves a particular mode of conceptualization.
    - **Translational Implications:** Beyond the surface meaning of the source text, it is crucial to understand how the speaker conceptualized and expressed it. The goal of translation is to 're-conceptualize' that conceptualization most naturally and appropriately in the target language (Korean).
- **Subjectification:** The phenomenon where the cognitive perspective and experience of the speaker or subject are integrated into linguistic expression. It reflects the speaker's emotions, attitudes, and perceptions beyond the objective delivery of facts.
    - Example: "Here comes the bus." (Reflects the speaker's subjective experience of the bus approaching from their location).
    - **Translational Implications:** The speaker's subjective attitude or emotion must be naturally embedded in the Korean expression by selecting appropriate 'tone,' 'endings,' and 'particles.'

## 2. Basic Components
- **Concept:** The basic unit of human thought and cognitive activity. Linguistic expressions activate these concepts, and a single concept can be realized through various linguistic expressions.
- **Schema:** An abstract and generalized cognitive structure formed through repeated experiences. It forms the basis of various linguistic expressions (vocabulary, grammatical structures). Schemas originate from physical experience and extend to abstract concepts.
    - **Translational Implications:** Understanding how a specific schema is realized in English and Korean allows for the transfer of the same cognitive meaning even if the surface structures differ.

## 3. Core Image Schemas - In-depth Understanding of 12 Schemas
These are fundamental cognitive structures derived from human spatial and bodily experiences, crucially used for the metaphorical/abstract extension of meaning and translational mapping.

- **1. CONTAINER Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** The fundamental schema for bounded spaces, involving concepts of being contained within, moving out of, or crossing boundaries. Applies to physical space as well as abstract containment like 'in love' or 'in trouble'.
    - **Translational Application:** Re-conceptualized in Korean using various particles and expressions for physical space (~안에, ~속에), abstract states (~에 빠지다, ~상태이다), and scopes of information (~내에, ~포함).

- **2. PATH Schema & SOURCE-PATH-GOAL Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** A schema for movement or progression, consisting of a starting point (Source), a (Path), and an endpoint (Goal). Applies not only to physical movement but also to the flow of time, processes, problem-solving, and information transfer as metaphorical 'paths'. SOURCE-PATH-GOAL is used when the start and end of the path are clear.
    - **Translational Application:** Implemented in Korean using various directional/process expressions like ~에서 ~까지 (from to), ~을/를 통해 (through), ~을/를 거쳐 (via), ~을/를 따라 (along), ~에 이르다 (reaching).

- **3. FORCE DYNAMICS Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** A schema representing the relationship of interacting forces between two or more entities (resistance, facilitation, hindrance, allowance, compulsion, etc.). Understands how external or internal forces affect a state or action.
    - **Translational Application:** Mapped to Korean causative, passive, and causal relationship expressions such as ~게 하다 (make/cause to), ~을/를 막다 (prevent), ~을/를 허락하다 (allow), ~을/를 극복하다 (overcome).

- **4. UP-DOWN Schema (Metaphorical Extension)**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** A schema derived from vertical directionality, metaphorically extended to concepts of increase/decrease, ascent/descent in quantity, state, emotion, value, status, etc.
    - **Translational Application:** Mapped to Korean metaphorical expressions and verb conjugations like ~이/가 오르다/내리다 (rise/fall), ~이/가 증가하다/감소하다 (increase/decrease), 기분이 좋다/가라앉다 (feel good/down).

- **5. PERSPECTIVE/PROFILING Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** Even for the same event or concept, linguistic expression changes based on which aspect (part) is 'focused' (Profiling) and which is backgrounded. It reflects the viewpoint or position from which the speaker conceptualizes the event.
    - **Translational Application:** Maintains or naturally adjusts the original perspective in Korean through active/passive voice conversion, subject/object selection, and emphasis/omission of specific information.

- **6. TR/LM (Trajector/Landmark) Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** The relationship between a focused entity (Trajector, TR) and a reference entity (Landmark, LM) in spatial relations or verb expressions. TR is the entity that moves or whose location is identified; LM is the reference point where TR is located or moves.
    - **Translational Application:** As Korean tends to present the LM first unlike English, understanding this relationship is key to natural word order and particle selection (e.g., 열쇠가 서랍 안에 있다 vs. 서랍 안에 열쇠가 있다).

- **7. BALANCE Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** The state of balance or imbalance of weight, force, state, quantity, etc. Expresses stability, equality, offset, equilibrium.
    - **Translational Application:** Mapped to related Korean conceptual terms and expressions like 균형 (balance), 평형 (equilibrium), 대등하다 (be equal), 상쇄하다 (offset), 압도하다 (overwhelm).

- **8. LINK Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** Represents that two or more entities are physically, abstractly, or logically connected. Expresses relationships, dependency, causality, affiliation.
    - **Translational Application:** Mapped to various Korean connection/relationship expressions like ~을/를 연결하다 (connect), ~와/과 관련되다 (be related to), ~에 달려있다 (depend on), ~을/를 초래하다 (cause).

- **9. PART-WHOLE Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** The relationship between a whole and its constituent parts. Conceptualizes elements forming a whole, possession, affiliation, composition.
    - **Translational Application:** Mapped to Korean part-whole relationship expressions like ~의 일부 (part of), ~을/를 구성하다 (constitute), ~에 속하다 (belong to), ~의 구성 요소 (component).

- **10. CENTER-PERIPHERY Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** Conceptualizes the relationship between a center and its periphery. Used to express core, importance, focus, peripheral elements.
    - **Translational Application:** Mapped to related Korean conceptual terms like 핵심 (core), 중심 (center), 주변부 (periphery), 외곽 (outskirts), 중요/비중요 (important/unimportant), 집중하다 (focus).

- **11. FRONT-BACK Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** A schema conceptualizing spatial front-back relationships, temporal sequence (past-future), or order of importance.
    - **Translational Application:** Mapped to Korean front-back expressions like ~앞에/~뒤에 (in front of/behind), ~전에/~후에 (before/after), 선두/후발 (leader/follower), 우선순위 (priority).

- **12. NEAR-FAR Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** Conceptualizes physical or psychological distance. Used to express intimacy, relevance, importance, temporal proximity.
    - **Translational Application:** Mapped to Korean near-far/distance concepts like ~근처에/~멀리 (near/far), 가까워지다/~멀어지다 (get closer/further), 긴밀하다/소원하다 (intimate/distant).

## 4. Linguistic Expression and Cognitive Perspective (Extension & Elaboration)
- **Extension & Elaboration:** The phenomenon where basic schemas or concepts are extended or modified in new contexts. (e.g., physical 'contain' extending to 'contain information')
    - **Translational Implications:** Identify the cognitive origin of metaphorical/abstract expressions to re-conceptualize them into the most natural metaphor or abstract expression in the target language.

## 5. Significance and Importance of Cognitive Grammar in Translation Application
- Translation is not merely changing vocabulary or grammar, but a 'conceptual interpretation' process that deeply understands the cognitive conceptualization, speaker's perspective, and embedded schemas of the source text, and then expresses them by re-conceptualizing in the most natural and appropriate way in the target language.
- Especially when language structures (word order, grammar, ways of extending meaning of vocabulary) differ significantly, like between English and Korean, preserving cognitive schemas and perspectives beyond surface translation, and transforming them to suit the target language, is key to translation quality.
