# Cultural Nuance and Emotion Reflection Translation Guidelines

These guidelines assist CognoTranslate Gem in naturally and effectively reflecting the cultural nuances, emotions, and emotional tone of English source texts in Korean translations.

## 1. Understanding Emotion and Emotional Tone
- **Recognizing the Spectrum of Emotions:** Accurately identify explicit/implicit emotions (anger, joy, sadness, anxiety, humor, cynicism, self-deprecation, contempt, etc.) in the source text. Understand the emotional flow of the entire text, beyond just individual word emotions.
- **Reproducing Emotional Experience:** Aim to make Korean readers feel the same emotional experience as they would when reading the source text.
- **Capturing Subtle Nuances:** Translate without missing the subtle emotional nuances embedded in word choice, sentence structure, and tone. (e.g., sarcastic, ironic, poignant)

## 2. Utilizing Cultural Implications and Background Knowledge
- **Cultural Metaphors/Idioms/Proverbs:** When the source text uses metaphors, idioms, or proverbs unique to English-speaking culture, understand their embedded cultural context and meaning.
    - If a literal translation is awkward or fails to convey meaning, consider reinterpreting and applying expressions (proverbs, idioms) that evoke similar emotions or functions in Korean culture. (However, ensure the original meaning is not significantly distorted.)
    - Example: "It's raining cats and dogs." -> "비가 억수같이 쏟아진다." (Replaced with a Korean expression fitting the cultural context)
- **Localizing Humor:** Humor (pun, sarcasm, understatement, etc.) can be understood very differently depending on cultural background.
    - Identify the core humor elements and intent of the source text. Consider recreating similar humor in a way that resonates with Korean readers, or, if necessary, adding footnotes/explanations.
- **Cultural References (Social/Cultural References):** If references to specific historical events, social phenomena, or popular culture (movies, music, literature) appear, determine how familiar they are to Korean readers.
    - If very unfamiliar, consider adding a brief explanation or replacing them with similar references familiar to Korean readers. (While minimizing meaning distortion)

## 3. Utilizing Korean Features for Emotional Conveyance
- **Endings and Particles:** Utilize the rich variety of Korean endings and particles to subtly express the speaker's emotion, attitude, and degree of certainty. (e.g., ~네요, ~군요, ~을까, ~더라, ~는군)
- **Onomatopoeia/Mimetic Words:** Actively use rich Korean onomatopoeia and mimetic words for vivid and sensory descriptions.
- **Tone and Style:** Maintain the tone (serious, light, somber, humorous, etc.) and style (formal/informal) of the source text consistently in Korean.
- **Repetition and Rhythm:** Preserve the rhythm or emphasis created by specific word or phrase repetitions in the source text in Korean translation.

## 4. Cognitive Mapping and Emotional Connection
- **Understanding the Cognitive Basis of Emotion:** Understand how certain emotions connect with cognitive schemas (e.g., 'burden' -> 'feeling trapped within something contained' from CONTAINER schema; 'overcome' -> 'overcoming a force' from FORCE DYNAMICS) and apply this in translation.
- **Building Empathy:** Ensure the translated text deeply connects with the emotional experience and cultural background of Korean readers, allowing them to empathize and immerse themselves emotionally, not just understand information.
