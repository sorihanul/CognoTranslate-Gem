# Translation Quality and Hallucination Review Checklist

## 1. Semantic Accuracy & Consistency
- [ ] Has the core meaning and intent of the source text been accurately reflected in the Korean translation? (Most important)
- [ ] Are there any awkward or misinterpreted parts in the context?
- [ ] Have polysemous words or homonyms been translated correctly according to the context?
- [ ] Have Cognitive Grammar concepts (schemas, perspectives, etc.) been naturally re-conceptualized into Korean while preserving the original intent?
- [ ] Have identical terms or proper nouns been translated consistently throughout the document? (Terminological consistency)
- [ ] Have the emphasis or subtle nuances of the source text been effectively conveyed?

## 2. Fluency & Naturalness in Korean
- [ ] Is the translated text natural and fluent for Korean readers? (Are there any awkward translationese, unnatural word order, or particle usage?)
- [ ] Are Korean grammar, spelling, and spacing accurate?
- [ ] Have appropriate honorifics/informal speech been used, fitting the target audience's level and situation (formal/informal)?
- [ ] Have cultural expressions (proverbs, idioms, metaphors) been reinterpreted to suit the Korean culture and sound natural?
- [ ] Are there any awkward or ungrammatical sentences?
- [ ] For novels, has the character's personality or speaker's unique tone/style been consistently reflected in the Korean translation?
- [ ] Are the narrative's inherent rhythm, sentence flow, and emotional progression vividly conveyed in Korean? (Especially crucial in literary translation)
- [ ] Is the literary beauty, rhythm, or metaphor of the source text appropriately alive?

## 3. Hallucination Detection (Fact-Checking & Fabrication)
- [ ] **Has any information or fact not present in the source text been added to the translation?** (Most critical error)
    - Example: Check if any dates, names, statistics, or events not in the source text have been added.
- [ ] **Has the content of the source text been exaggerated or understated in the translation?** (Meaning distortion)
- [ ] **Has the translation distorted the logical flow or causal relationships of the source text?**
- [ ] **Has uncertain information been translated as certain?** (e.g., 'may be' translated as 'is')

## 4. Completeness & Omissions
- [ ] Has all content (text, numbers, etc.) from the source text been included in the translation without omission?
- [ ] Has any important information or context been omitted?

## 5. Transparency & Explainability
- [ ] (If necessary) Can explanations be provided for key conceptual transformations or reinterpretations used in the translation?
- [ ] (If necessary) Does it honestly recognize difficult or ambiguous translation parts and suggest alternatives?
- [ ] (If necessary) When it's difficult to transfer literary devices (wordplay, specific symbols) from the source text into Korean, can the limitations and intended translation direction be clearly explained?

## 6. Ethics & Compliance
- [ ] Does the translated text contain hate speech, discriminatory expressions, or violent content? (Compliance with regulations)
- [ ] Is personal identifiable information (PII) or sensitive information handled securely? (GDPR/AI Act, etc.)

**Additional Self-Reflection and Judgment Criteria:**
- [ ] Are you confident that your translated result is the best output from 'CognoTranslate Gem'? Have you deeply considered if a better translation is possible?
- [ ] Can the emotional depth and literary intent of the source text provide Korean readers with the 'same emotional experience as the original'?
- [ ] Has a 'creative re-conceptualization' beyond mechanical translation been achieved through subjective judgment?

**Actions after Review:**
- [ ] If any of the checklist items are judged as 'No' or 'Doubtful', modify or attempt to re-translate that part.
- [ ] Especially if hallucination is detected, immediately remove it by cross-referencing with the source text and replace it with accurate information.
