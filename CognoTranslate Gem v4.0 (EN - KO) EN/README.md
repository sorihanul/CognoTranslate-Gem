# CognoTranslate Gem v4.0: Cognitive-Based Korean Translation Agent

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

**CognoTranslate Gem v4.0** is an advanced cognitive-based translation agent that goes beyond mere linguistic conversion. It deeply understands the **cognitive and conceptual essence** of the source text and **re-conceptualize** it into Korean in the most natural and rich manner. This project actively integrates the principles of Cognitive Grammar into the translation process, aiming to subtly reflect the nuances and cultural contexts between languages.

While traditional translation systems often stop at superficial word-for-word or sentence-for-sentence conversion, CognoTranslate Gem mimics the human way of thinking and how language constructs concepts, thereby elevating translation from a mere function to an **"art of meaning transfer."**

**This project was developed in the Google Gemini Gems environment, specifically utilizing the Gemini 2.5 Flash model, to explore the remarkable potential of cognitive-based translation and has yielded significant results.**

## ‚ú® Key Features and Characteristics

* **Deep Cognitive Grammar-Based Analysis:** Beyond the surface meaning of the English source text, it deeply grasps the **inherent conceptual schemas (Image Schemas)**, the speaker's **perspective**, and **modes of conceptualization** within sentences.
* **Language-Independent Conceptual Intermediate Representation Generation:** Based on the analyzed cognitive concepts, it internally generates a **'conceptual intermediate representation'** that is language-independent, compressing the meaning of the source text into its purest form.
* **Cultural Nuance and Emotion Mapping:** Accurately identifies **cultural implications** such as emotions, sentiments, metaphors, and humor expressed in the source text, and maps them to be most appropriately recreated within the Korean cultural context.
* **Natural Re-conceptualization in Korean:** Generates **natural and fluid Korean sentences** that preserve the original cognitive schemas and perspectives, while adhering to Korean grammar, word order, vocabulary, and cultural context. Especially for literary translations like novels, it prioritizes emotional immersion and narrative rhythm.
* **Advanced Quality and Reliability Review:**
    * Includes **hallucination detection** and correction features to prevent the generation of information not present in the source text.
    * Utilizes a **translation quality improvement loop** to self-verify and enhance the accuracy and naturalness of the translated output.
    * Strictly adheres to the latest security and ethical regulations such as **GDPR, AI Act 2025, and OWASP AI Top 10** to provide secure and reliable translations.
    * Considers **user comprehension of the translated expressions** as a core review criterion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Translation Workflow (Internal Processing)

1.  **[Stage 1: Cognitive Analysis of Source Text]**
    * Analyzes the English source text at a token level, identifying parts of speech and syntactic structures.
    * Extracts core meaning, speaker's intent, contextual nuances, and specifically identifies conceptual schemas, perspectives, modes of conceptualization, and emotions based on Cognitive Grammar.
2.  **[Stage 2: Conceptual Intermediate Representation Generation & Emotion/Culture Mapping]**
    * Integrates all cognitive concepts analyzed in Stage 1 to internally structure a language-independent 'conceptual intermediate representation'.
    * Identifies emotions, sentiments, and cultural implications from the source text, and explores methods for their recreation in the Korean cultural context.
3.  **[Stage 3: Korean Re-conceptualization & Sentence Generation]**
    * Based on the 'conceptual intermediate representation' and emotion/cultural information from Stage 2, it re-conceptualizes and generates the final Korean sentences in the most appropriate and natural way, adhering to Korean grammar, word order, vocabulary, and cultural context.
    * Actively utilizes Korean characteristics such as subject omission, flexible word order, use of particles and endings, and honorifics/informal speech to create fluid sentences.
4.  **[Stage 4: Quality and Compliance Review]**
    * Thoroughly reviews and corrects for hallucinations, meaning distortions, and information omissions.
    * Ensures compliance with personal data protection and ethical regulations to guarantee secure and reliable output.

## üë©‚Äçüíª How to Create and Use This Gem in Gemini Gems

To implement and use `CognoTranslate Gem v4.0` in the Gemini Gems environment, follow these steps:

1.  **Access Gemini Gems:**
    * Navigate to the Gemini interface where you can create or manage custom Gems.

2.  **Create a New Gem:**
    * Find options like "Create a Gem" or "Build your own Gem" and start creating a new one.

3.  **Define Gem Instructions:**
    * Copy the **entire content of the `CognoTranslate Gem.md` file**. This content will serve as the **main Instructions** for this Gem, encompassing all translation workflows and principles.
    * Paste this content into the **"Instructions"** or **"Prompt"** input field of your new Gem.

4.  **Upload Knowledge Files:**
    * Locate the area in the Gemini Gems interface where you can upload files. Typically, **up to 10 files can be uploaded.**
    * Upload all **5 `.md` files** listed below. These files will be used by the Gem to reference in-depth grammatical, cultural, and quality control knowledge:
        * `Cognitive Grammar Core Concepts and Terminology.md`
        * `Image Schema English-Korean Mapping Examples.md`
        * `Translation Quality and Hallucination Review Checklist.md`
        * `Cultural Nuance and Emotion Reflection Translation Guidelines.md`
        * `Novel Translation Tuning Guidelines: Genre and Audience-Specific Strategies.md`

5.  **Test the Gem:**
    * After completing all settings, thoroughly test the Gem with various English texts (novels, general texts, etc.). Verify that the Gem applies the configured workflows and knowledge to generate rich and natural Korean translations.
