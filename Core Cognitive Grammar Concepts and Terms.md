# Core Cognitive Grammar Concepts and Terms

## 1. The Nature of Language (Language as Conceptualization)
- **Conceptualization:** Language is not merely a reflection of objective reality but an act of 'constructing' and 'interpreting' the world from a specific perspective, based on how humans understand, experience, and imagine it. Every linguistic expression involves a particular mode of conceptualization.
- **Subjectification:** The phenomenon where the speaker's or subject's cognitive perspective is integrated into the linguistic expression. For example, 'Here comes the bus' reflects the speaker's subjective experience of the bus approaching from their location.

## 2. Basic Components
- **Concept:** The basic unit of human thought and cognitive activity. Linguistic expressions activate these concepts.
- **Schema:** An abstract and generalized cognitive structure formed through repeated experiences. It serves as the basis for various linguistic expressions. (e.g., CONTAINER, PATH)

## 3. Core Image Schemas
- These are fundamental cognitive structures derived from human spatial experience, also used for abstract/figurative meaning extensions.
  - **CONTAINER:** A schema about a bounded space with an 'inside' and an 'outside.' It applies not only to physical spaces but also to abstract inclusions like 'in love' or 'in trouble.'
    - Example: "He is **in** the room." (Physical inclusion)
    - Example: "She is **in** love." (Abstract inclusion)
  - **PATH:** A schema about movement composed of a starting point (Source), a path, and a destination (Goal). It applies not only to physical movement but also to the passage of time, problem-solving processes, etc.
    - Example: "He walked **from** home **to** school." (Physical path)
    - Example: "We went **through** many difficulties." (Figurative path, overcoming hardship)
  - **SOURCE-PATH-GOAL:** An extended form of the PATH schema, where the source, path, and goal are clearly distinguished.
  - **FORCE DYNAMICS:** A schema representing the relationship of interacting forces between two or more entities (resistance, facilitation, hindrance, etc.). It is inherent in verbs like 'push,' 'pull,' 'resist.'
    - Example: "He **pushed** the door open." (Application of force)
  - **BALANCE:** The state of equilibrium of weight or force. Related to concepts like 'equal,' 'stable.'
  - **LINK:** Indicates that two or more entities are connected. Inherent in verbs like 'connect,' 'relate.'
  - **UP-DOWN:** Vertical direction. Used metaphorically for states (happiness-sadness) and quantities (increase-decrease).
    - Example: "I'm feeling **up** today." (Feeling good)

## 4. Linguistic Expression and Cognitive Perspective
- **Perspective/Profiling:** Even for the same event or concept, expressions vary depending on which aspect the language highlights and which is relegated to the background.
  - Example: "John **bought** a book from Mary." (Profiling John and the act of buying)
  - Example: "Mary **sold** a book to John." (Profiling Mary and the act of selling)
  - **Trajector (TR) & Landmark (LM):** In spatial relationships or verb expressions, the object of focus (TR) and the reference object (LM). In 'The bird is **on** the branch,' 'bird' is the TR, 'branch' is the LM.
- **Extension & Elaboration:** The phenomenon where basic schemas or concepts are extended or transformed when used in new contexts. (e.g., physical 'contain' extending to 'contain information')

## 5. Significance of Applying Cognitive Grammar in Translation
- Translation is not merely changing vocabulary or grammar but understanding the cognitive conceptualization and perspective embedded in the source text and re-conceptualizing it in the most natural and appropriate way in the target language.
- Especially when language structures are divergent, such as between English and Korean, preserving and transforming cognitive schemas and perspectives beyond surface translation is key to translation quality.
