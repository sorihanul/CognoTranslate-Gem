# Translation Quality and Hallucination Review Checklist

## 1. Semantic Accuracy & Consistency
- [ ] Is the core meaning and intent of the original text accurately reflected in the Korean translation? (Most Important)
- [ ] Are there any awkward or misunderstood parts in context?
- [ ] Are polysemous words or homonyms translated appropriately according to context?
- [ ] Are cognitive grammar concepts (schemas, perspectives, etc.) naturally re-conceptualized in Korean while maintaining the original intent?
- [ ] Are the same terms or proper nouns translated consistently throughout the document? (Terminological Consistency)
- [ ] Are the emphasis and subtle nuances of the original text well conveyed?

## 2. Fluency & Naturalness in Korean
- [ ] Is the translated text natural and elegant for Korean speakers to read? (No translationese, awkward word order, or particle usage?)
- [ ] Are Korean grammar, spelling, and spacing accurate?
- [ ] Are appropriate honorifics/plain speech used for the target audience's level and situation (formal/informal)?
- [ ] Are cultural expressions (proverbs, idioms, metaphors) re-interpreted appropriately for Korean and natural?
- [ ] Are there any awkward or unnatural ungrammatical sentences?

## 3. Hallucination Detection (Fact-Checking & Fabrication)
- [ ] **Has information or facts not present in the original text been added to the translation?** (Most critical error)
  - Example: Check if non-existent dates, names, statistics, events, etc., have been added.
- [ ] **Has the content of the original text been exaggerated or understated in the translation?** (Meaning distortion)
- [ ] **Does the translation not distort the logical flow or causal relationship of the original text?**
- [ ] **Has uncertain information been translated as certain?** (e.g., 'may be' as 'is')

## 4. Completeness & Omissions
- [ ] Is all content (text, numbers, etc.) from the original text included in the translation without omission?
- [ ] Has no important information or context been omitted?

## 5. Transparency & Explainability
- [ ] (If necessary) Can an explanation be provided for major conceptual transformation processes or reinterpretations used in the translation?
- [ ] (If necessary) Does it honestly recognize difficult or ambiguous parts of the translation and offer alternatives?

## 6. Ethics & Compliance
- [ ] Does the translation not contain hate speech, discriminatory expressions, or violent content? (Compliance with regulations)
- [ ] Is personal identifiable information (PII) or sensitive information handled securely? (GDPR/AI Act, etc.)

**Actions after review:**
- [ ] If any of the checklist items above are judged as 'No' or 'Doubtful,' correct the part or attempt re-translation.
- [ ] Especially if hallucination is detected, immediately remove the part by comparing it with the original text and replace it with accurate information.
