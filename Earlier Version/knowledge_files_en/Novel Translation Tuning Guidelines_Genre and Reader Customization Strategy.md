---

## üöÄ Overview

These guidelines provide advanced tuning strategies to help CognoTranslate Gem adjust the subtle 'texture' of translations for novels, aligning with specific genre characteristics and target reader expectations. The core of translation is to maintain the cognitive and conceptual essence of the original while re-conceptualizing it into the most natural and rich Korean for the reader.

## ‚ú® Tuning Point 1: Genre-Specific Tuning

Guidelines for translating to preserve the unique atmosphere, narrative tension, and linguistic features of each genre.

### 1. Gothic/Psychological Horror
* **Vocabulary:** Emphasize words and expressions that evoke a dark, unsettling, and fragmented feel (e.g., 'eerie,' 'chilling,' 'ominous,' 'twisted,' 'fissure,' 'echoing').
* **Sentence Structure:** Use a mix of short, concise sentences and long, complex ones to create tension and uncertainty. Emphasize inner monologue structures and allow for unconventional sentence flow that reflects unstable psychological states.
* **Sound/Color:** Focus on descriptions of sound and color to create an atmospheric and overwhelming ambiance (e.g., 'blood-red,' 'dismal,' 'piercing scream,' 'whispering,' 'blurred outlines').
* **Metaphor/Symbolism:** Maintain the metaphors and symbolic ambiguity of the original, leaving room for the reader's own interpretation to maximize the sense of mystery.
* **Primary Goal:** Effectively convey tension, unease, immersion, and mental disarray.

### 2. Psychological Drama
* **Vocabulary:** Carefully select vocabulary that reflects the character's emotional state, internal conflicts, and subtle psychological shifts (e.g., 'subtle,' 'pent-up,' 'unconscious,' 'hesitant,' 'exploring').
* **Sentence Structure:** Prefer sentence structures that emphasize inner monologue and stream of consciousness, focusing on organic connections to follow the character's thought process.
* **Emotion Layer Tracking:** Precisely track and reflect the complex psychological layers hidden beneath surface emotions in the translation.
* **Primary Goal:** Deeply convey the characters' inner worlds and complex psychological arcs.

### 3. Realism/Social Critique
* **Vocabulary:** Use concise, concrete, and everyday vocabulary to enhance realism. Emphasize direct action descriptions (e.g., 'unadorned,' 'objective,' 'sharp,' 'specific,' 'factual').
* **Sentence Structure:** Prefer clear and direct sentence structures, focusing on narrative consistency and factual delivery.
* **Detailed Description:** Faithfully reproduce minute details of characters and settings to capture the texture of reality.
* **Primary Goal:** Convey social realities or personal lives without embellishment, objectively, and with persuasive power.

### 4. Lyrical/Fantasy Literature
* **Vocabulary:** Actively use sensory, metaphorical, and beautiful vocabulary (e.g., 'dreamlike,' 'radiant,' 'faint,' 'brilliant,' 'whispering').
* **Rhythm/Cadence:** Preserve the rhythm and cadence of sentences to create a musical feel and induce emotional immersion.
* **Metaphor/Figurative Language:** Reconstruct rich metaphors and similes using the beauty of the Korean language, stimulating emotional imagination.
* **Primary Goal:** Deeply appeal to the reader's senses and emotions, poetically recreating fantastical worlds or beautiful scenes.

### 5. Web Novel
* **Vocabulary:** Use modern and intuitive vocabulary, with flexibility for neologisms and trending words (but not excessively). For genre-specific terms (e.g., regression, possession, system), maintain the original nuance for consistency.
* **Sentence Structure:** Maintain a fast pace with short, concise sentences. Ensure natural transitions between viewpoints and dialogue. Express narrative devices that evoke reader emotional responses (e.g., 'refreshing,' 'frustrating' moments) appropriately in Korean.
* **Pacing:** Prioritize the narrative's pacing, minimizing unnecessary embellishments or background descriptions that might hinder reader immersion. Ensure core events and character emotions are conveyed quickly.
* **Reader Feedback (Optional):** Understand the preferences of web novel readers and, if necessary, flexibly incorporate popular expressions or plot developments into the translation.
* **Primary Goal:** Maximize the unique appeal of web novels by prioritizing fast readability, genre-specific entertainment, and reader emotional satisfaction.

## ‚ú® Tuning Point 2: Reader-Specific Tuning

Adjust vocabulary, sentence difficulty, and interpretative layers based on the characteristics of the target readership.

### 1. Young Adult Readers
* **Vocabulary:** Use simple, easy-to-understand words and avoid overly complex jargon or archaic language.
* **Sentence Simplification:** Simplify complex or excessively long sentences to improve readability.
* **Enhanced Internal Explanation:** Briefly add internal explanations for parts that might not be clear from context to aid reader comprehension.
* **Primary Goal:** Spark interest and provide a fast narrative flow to keep readers engaged.

### 2. Classic/Literary Enthusiasts
* **Vocabulary:** Strive to maintain the archaic vocabulary or unique literary expressions of the original, actively utilizing archaic Korean tones and beautiful expressions.
* **Aesthetic Sentence Structure:** Preserve the aesthetic value of the original sentence structure as much as possible in Korean.
* **Interpretative Layer Preservation:** Do not dilute multilayered meanings or symbolism, leaving room for readers to explore deeply on their own.
* **Primary Goal:** Fully convey the literary dignity and aesthetic value of the original, providing a profound reading experience.

### 3. Literary Critics
* **Emphasis on Symbolism/Metaphor:** Clearly highlight symbols, metaphors, and allegories in the original to facilitate critical analysis.
* **Structural Contrast:** Ensure that contrasts, repetitions, and specific literary techniques within the narrative structure are clearly evident in the translation.
* **Clarification of Interpretative Points:** Preserve points open to various interpretations while ensuring that the meaning is not distorted by translation.
* **Primary Goal:** Provide a basis for academic analysis and critical discussion, accurately reflecting the complex literary devices of the original.

### 4. General Readers
* **Narrative Flow Priority:** Focus on the smooth flow of the narrative and the emotional lines of the characters rather than literary techniques or profound interpretations.
* **Enhanced Emotional Appeal:** Emphasize emotional appeal so that readers can easily empathize and immerse themselves in the translation.
* **Readability First:** Concentrate on creating sentences that are easy to understand and comfortable to read.
* **Primary Goal:** Increase accessibility and broad appeal so that a wide range of readers can enjoy the translated work without burden.
