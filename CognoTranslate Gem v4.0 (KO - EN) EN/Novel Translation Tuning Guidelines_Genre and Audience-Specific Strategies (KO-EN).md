## 1. Understanding Genre Characteristics and Translation Strategies for KO-EN
The genre of a Korean novel significantly influences the English translation's tone, pacing, vocabulary choice, and sentence structure.

### 1.1. Gothic/Psychological Horror (고딕/심리 공포)
- **Korean Characteristics:** Often employs archaic or formal language for a sense of dread, subtle psychological descriptions, slow build-up of tension, rich symbolism, and indirect expressions of horror.
- **Translation Strategy (KO-EN):**
    - **Tone:** Maintain an eerie, unsettling, and chilling tone. Prefer evocative and unsettling English expressions over direct ones. Avoid overly modern or casual English.
    - **Vocabulary:** Choose English vocabulary that evokes an archaic, ominous, or disturbing feeling. (e.g., consider 'gloomy', 'shrouded', 'ominous', 'haunted' for '음침한', '으스스한', '불길한' rather than just 'dark' or 'scary').
    - **Sentence Structure:** Use long, complex English sentences to gradually build suspense and pressure. Alternatively, use sudden short sentences to emphasize shock or a sudden realization.
    - **Rhythm:** Aim for a slow and heavy rhythm in English to effectively build tension and dread.

### 1.2. Psychological Drama (심리 드라마)

    - **Vocabulary:** Use rich English vocabulary that describes abstract emotions and internal states accurately. Ensure emotional depth is conveyed.
