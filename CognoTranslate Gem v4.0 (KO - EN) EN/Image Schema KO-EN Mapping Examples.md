# Image Schema KO-EN Mapping Examples (Translation Guide)

This document provides comprehensive mapping examples for 12 key Cognitive Grammar schemas and their translation from Korean to English, which CognoTranslate Gem refers to when performing Korean-to-English translation based on Cognitive Grammar principles.

## 1. CONTAINER Schema
- **Cognitive Meaning:** The fundamental schema for bounded spaces, involving concepts of being contained within, moving out of, or crossing boundaries. Applies to physical space as well as abstract containment like '사랑에 빠지다' (to fall in love) or '곤경에 처하다' (to be in trouble).
- **Korean Examples:** ~안(에), ~밖(에), ~속(에), ~내부에, ~외부에, ~에 빠지다, ~상태이다, ~내에서
- **English Mapping Examples:**
    - Physical Space: *in, out of, inside, outside, within*
        - "그는 방 **안에** 있다." -> "He is **in** the room."
        - "고양이가 상자 **밖으로** 뛰어 나왔다." -> "The cat jumped **out of** the box."
    - Abstract Containment:
        - "그녀는 사랑**에 빠져** 있다." -> "She is **in** love." (implies being within the abstract boundary of love)
        - "그는 곤경**에 처해** 있다." -> "He is **in** trouble."
        - "그 정보는 보고서 **안에** 있다." -> "The information is **in** the report." (implies being contained within the informational boundary of the report)
        - "그는 감정을 **속으로** 감췄다." -> "He kept his feelings **inside**."
        - "프로젝트는 예산 **범위 내에서** 완료되어야 한다." -> "The project must be completed **within** the budget."

## 2. PATH Schema & SOURCE-PATH-GOAL Schema
- **Cognitive Meaning:** A schema for movement or progression, consisting of a starting point (Source), a (Path), and an endpoint (Goal). Applies not only to physical movement but also to the flow of time, processes, problem-solving, etc.
- **Korean Examples:** ~에서 ~까지, ~을/를 통해, ~을/를 가로질러, ~을/를 따라, ~안으로/~속으로, ~위로, ~쪽으로, ~로부터 멀어져, ~을 겪다, ~을 헤쳐 나가다, ~에 빠지다, ~을 향해 나아가다
- **English Mapping Examples:**
    - Physical Movement: *from ~ to ~, through, across, along, into/inside, onto, toward, away from*
        - "그는 공원**에서** 도서관**까지** 걸었다." -> "He walked **from** the park **to** the library."

        - "독립**을 향해** 나아가다." -> "Moving **toward** independence."

## 3. FORCE DYNAMICS Schema
- **Cognitive Meaning:** The relationship of interacting forces between two or more entities (resistance, facilitation, hindrance, allowance, compulsion, etc.).
- **Korean Examples:** ~을/를 막다, ~을/를 허락하다, ~을/를 밀다, ~에 저항하다, ~을 촉진하다, ~게 하다 (causative)

- **Cognitive Meaning:** A schema derived from vertical directionality, extended to concepts of increase/decrease, ascent/descent in quantity, state, emotion, value, status, etc.
- **Korean Examples:** ~이/가 오르다/내리다, ~이/가 증가하다/감소하다, 기분이 좋다/가라앉다, 높다/낮다, 추락하다, 침체되다
- **English Mapping Examples:**
    - Emotion/Mood:
        - "오늘 기분이 **좋다**." / "오늘 컨디션이 **올라왔다**." -> "I'm feeling **good** today." / "My condition has **improved** today."
        - "그는 그 소식 후에 기분이 **가라앉았다**." / "그는 우울했다." -> "He felt **down** after the news." / "He felt depressed."

## 5. PERSPECTIVE/PROFILING Schema
- **Cognitive Meaning:** Changes in expression based on which aspect of the same event or concept is 'profiled' (focused) and which is backgrounded. It reflects the viewpoint or position from which the speaker conceptualizes the event (e.g., active/passive, close/distant) and which object is taken as the 'focus (Trajector)' and which aspect is 'highlighted'. Korean's frequent subject omission requires careful profiling in English.
- **Korean/English Mapping Examples:**
    - Agent and Action Focus:
        - "존이 메리에게서 책을 **샀다**." (Focus on John's buying action) -> "John **bought** a book from Mary."
        - "메리가 존에게 책을 **팔았다**." (Focus on Mary's selling action) -> "Mary **sold** a book to John."
    - State Change vs. Agent Emphasis:
        - "문이 **열렸다**." (Focus on the state change of the door) -> "The door **opened**."
        - "그가 문을 **열었다**." (Focus on the agent's action) -> "He **opened** the door."
    - **Handling Korean Subject Omission & Passive/Active Voice:**
        - "이 문제는 **해결될 것이다**." (Focus on the problem's resolution, passive-like) -> "This problem **will be solved**." (English passive often preferred)
        - "그는 그 문제**를 해결했다**." (Focus on the agent's action) -> "He **solved** the problem."
        - "피곤해서 **잠이 들었다**." (Focus on the subject's experience, implied 'I') -> "I **fell asleep** due to tiredness."

## 6. TR/LM (Trajector/Landmark) Schema
- **Cognitive Meaning:** The relationship between a focused entity (Trajector, TR) and a reference entity (Landmark, LM) in spatial relations or verb expressions. TR is the entity that moves or whose location is identified; LM is the reference point where TR is located or moves. Korean often places the LM before the TR.
- **Korean Examples:** ~안에, ~위에, ~옆에 (inherent in postpositions)
- **English Mapping Examples:**
    - '서랍 **안에** 열쇠가 있다.' (Drawer-LM, Key-TR; Korean LM-TR order) -> 'The key is **in** the drawer.' (Key-TR, Drawer-LM; English TR-LM order)
    - '차가 나무 **옆에** 있다.' (Tree-LM, Car-TR) -> 'The car is **beside** the tree.' (Car-TR, Tree-LM)
    - '책상이 방 **가운데에** 있다.' (Room-LM, Desk-TR) -> 'The desk is **in the middle of** the room.' (Desk-TR, Room-LM)

    - "그들은 **안정적인** 합의에 도달했다." -> "They reached a **stable** agreement."
    - "천칭이 한쪽으로 **기울었다**." -> "The scales **tipped** to one side." (imbalance)

## 8. LINK Schema
- **Cognitive Meaning:** Represents that two or more entities are physically, abstractly, or logically connected. Expresses relationships, dependency, causality, affiliation. Korean particles (e.g., ~와/과, ~에) often implicitly convey these links.
- **Korean Examples:** ~을/를 연결하다, ~와/과 관련되다, ~에 달려있다, ~을/를 초래하다, ~와/과 관계있다
- **English Mapping Examples:**
    - "다리가 두 도시**를 연결한다**." -> "The bridge **connects** the two cities."

    - "**핵심** 쟁점은 신뢰다." -> "The **core** issue is trust." / "The **central** issue is trust."
    - "그는 도시 **외곽에서** 일한다." -> "He works on the **outskirts** of the city." / "He works in the **periphery** of the city."

        - "두 사람의 관계가 **소원해졌다**." -> "The relationship between the two became **distant**."

## Other Cognitive Considerations in KO-EN Translation
- **Nominalization vs. Verbalization:** Korean often prefers nominalizations (e.g., using ~음/~기 forms) where English would prefer a verb. The translator must re-conceptualize these into natural English verb constructions.
    - "그의 **도움**이 컸다." (His help was big) -> "He **helped** a lot." (emphasizing the verb 'helped')
    - "기차가 **도착하는** 것이 지연되었다." -> "The **arrival** of the train was delayed." / "The train's **arrival** was delayed." (Converting the Korean verbal noun into an English nominal)
- **Subject Omission:** Korean frequently omits subjects when clear from context. The English translation must infer and explicitly state the subject for clarity and grammatical correctness.
    - "어제 학교에 갔다." -> "I went to school yesterday." (Implied 'I')
- **Honorifics (존댓말/반말):** Korean honorifics convey social hierarchy and respect. English lacks direct equivalents; the translator must infer the social context and convey respect or familiarity through tone, vocabulary, and sentence structure (e.g., more formal vs. informal expressions, using titles vs. first names).
- **Korean Particles (조사):** Korean particles carry significant relational meaning (subject, object, topic, emphasis, etc.). The translator must accurately convey the cognitive function of these particles using appropriate English prepositions, word order, or sentence structures.
    - '~은/는' (Topic/Contrast) vs. '~이/가' (Subject): These impact profiling.
    - '~만' (only), '~도' (also/even): Conveying focus and emphasis.
- **Contextual Implicature:** Korean relies heavily on context and implicature. The English translation may need to make certain implied meanings more explicit for clarity for a non-Korean speaking audience, without adding new information.
