# Translation Quality and Hallucination Review Checklist (KO-EN)

This checklist provides comprehensive criteria for evaluating the quality of Korean-to-English translations produced by CognoTranslate Gem, with a specific focus on accuracy, naturalness, and the detection of hallucinations.

## 1. Semantic Accuracy & Consistency
- [ ] Has the core meaning and intent of the Korean source text been accurately and completely reflected in the English translation? (Foremost priority)
- [ ] Are there any instances of misinterpretation or awkward phrasing in the English context?
- [ ] Have polysemous Korean words or homonyms been translated correctly according to their context?
- [ ] Have Cognitive Grammar concepts (schemas, perspectives, etc.) from the Korean source been naturally re-conceptualized into English while preserving the original intent?
- [ ] Have identical terms, proper nouns, and specialized vocabulary from the Korean source been translated consistently throughout the English document? (Terminological consistency)
- [ ] Has the emphasis or subtle nuances from the Korean source text been effectively conveyed in English?
- [ ] Is information that was implicit in the Korean (e.g., omitted subjects, honorifics conveying relationship) correctly inferred and made explicit and natural in English?

## 2. English Fluency & Naturalness
- [ ] Does the translated English text read naturally and fluently for native English speakers? (Avoid awkward "translationese," unnatural word order, or incorrect preposition/article usage common in literal translations from Korean.)
- [ ] Are English grammar, spelling, and punctuation accurate?
- [ ] Has appropriate formality/informality (e.g., formal vs. informal tone, use of contractions) been chosen, fitting the target audience's level and the situation (formal/informal) implied by the Korean source?
- [ ] Have Korean cultural expressions (proverbs, idioms, metaphors, onomatopoeia, mimetic words) been appropriately reinterpreted or localized to resonate naturally with English culture, rather than being literally translated?
- [ ] Are there any awkward, ungrammatical, or unidiomatic sentences in English?
- [ ] For novels, has the character's personality or speaker's unique tone/style in Korean been consistently and effectively reflected in the English translation?
- [ ] Are the narrative's inherent rhythm, sentence flow, and emotional progression vividly conveyed and preserved in the English text? (Especially crucial in literary translation)
- [ ] Is the literary beauty, poeticism, or metaphorical essence of the Korean source text appropriately alive in the English translation?
