# Cognitive Grammar Core Concepts and Terminology (KO-EN)

This document provides essential knowledge for CognoTranslate Gem to understand the theoretical foundation and key concepts of Cognitive Grammar, and to perform in-depth Korean-to-English translations based on this understanding.

## 1. The Nature of Language (Language as Conceptualization)
- **Conceptualization:** Language is not merely a reflection of objective reality, but an act of 'constructing' and 'interpreting' the world from a specific perspective, based on how humans understand, experience, and imagine it. Every linguistic expression involves a particular mode of conceptualization.
    - **Translational Implications:** Beyond the surface meaning of the Korean source text, it is crucial to understand how the speaker conceptualized and expressed it. The goal of Korean-to-English translation is to 're-conceptualize' that conceptualization most naturally and appropriately in the target language (English).
- **Subjectification:** The phenomenon where the cognitive perspective and experience of the speaker or subject are integrated into linguistic expression. It reflects the speaker's emotions, attitudes, and cognitive states beyond the objective delivery of facts.
    - Example: "버스가 저기 온다." (Reflects the speaker's subjective experience of the bus approaching their location).
    - **Translational Implications:** The speaker's subjective attitude or emotion must be naturally embedded in the English expression by selecting appropriate 'tone,' 'verb choices,' and 'adverbs.'

## 2. Basic Components
- **Concept:** The basic unit of human thought and cognitive activity. Linguistic expressions activate these concepts, and a single concept can be realized through various linguistic expressions.
- **Schema:** An abstract and generalized cognitive structure formed through repeated experiences. It forms the basis of various linguistic expressions (vocabulary, grammatical structures). Schemas originate from physical experience and extend to abstract concepts.
    - **Translational Implications:** Understanding how a specific schema is realized in Korean and English allows for the transfer of the same cognitive meaning even if the surface structures differ.

## 3. Core Image Schemas - In-depth Understanding of 12 Schemas
These are fundamental cognitive structures derived from human spatial and bodily experiences, crucially used for the metaphorical/abstract extension of meaning and translational mapping from Korean to English.

- **1. CONTAINER Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** The fundamental schema for bounded spaces, involving concepts of being contained within, moving out of, or crossing boundaries. Applies to physical space as well as abstract containment like '사랑에 빠지다' (to fall in love) or '곤경에 처하다' (to be in trouble).
    - **KO-EN Translational Application:** Re-conceptualized in English using various prepositions and expressions for physical space (e.g., *in*, *inside*, *out of*, *outside*, *within*), abstract states (e.g., *fall into*, *be in a state of*), and scopes of information (e.g., *within the scope of*, *included in*).

- **2. PATH Schema & SOURCE-PATH-GOAL Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** A schema for movement or progression, consisting of a starting point (Source), a (Path), and an endpoint (Goal). Applies not only to physical movement but also to the flow of time, processes, problem-solving, and information transfer as metaphorical 'paths'. SOURCE-PATH-GOAL is used when the start and end of the path are clear.
    - **KO-EN Translational Application:** Implemented in English using various directional/process expressions like *from ~ to ~*, *through*, *via*, *along*, *reaching to*. Emphasize capturing the directionality or process inherent in Korean particles and verbal forms.

- **3. FORCE DYNAMICS Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** A schema representing the relationship of interacting forces between two or more entities (resistance, facilitation, hindrance, allowance, compulsion, etc.). Understands how external or internal forces affect a state or action.
    - **KO-EN Translational Application:** Mapped to English causative, passive, and causal relationship expressions such as *make/cause to*, *prevent*, *allow*, *overcome*. Pay attention to how Korean verbs/expressions (e.g., ~게 하다, ~을/를 막다) convey these force dynamics.

- **4. UP-DOWN Schema (Metaphorical Extension)**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** A schema derived from vertical directionality, metaphorically extended to concepts of increase/decrease, ascent/descent in quantity, state, emotion, value, status, etc.
    - **KO-EN Translational Application:** Mapped to English metaphorical expressions and verb conjugations like *rise/fall*, *increase/decrease*, *feel good/down*. Understand that Korean expressions might implicitly use this schema (e.g., '기분이 가라앉다' for feeling down).

- **5. PERSPECTIVE/PROFILING Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** Even for the same event or concept, linguistic expression changes based on which aspect (part) is 'focused' (Profiling) and which is backgrounded. It reflects the viewpoint or position from which the speaker conceptualizes the event (e.g., active/passive, close/distant) and which object is taken as the 'focus (Trajector)' and which aspect is 'highlighted'.
    - **KO-EN Translational Application:** Maintains or naturally adjusts the original Korean perspective in English through active/passive voice conversion, subject/object selection, and emphasis/omission of specific information. Korean often omits subjects; the translator must infer and profile the correct subject in English.

- **6. TR/LM (Trajector/Landmark) Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** The relationship between a focused entity (Trajector, TR) and a reference entity (Landmark, LM) in spatial relations or verb expressions. TR is the entity that moves or whose location is identified; LM is the reference point where TR is located or moves.
    - **KO-EN Translational Application:** As Korean often presents the LM first before the TR, understanding this relationship is key to natural English word order and preposition selection (e.g., '서랍 안에 열쇠가 있다' -> 'The key is in the drawer').

- **7. BALANCE Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** The state of balance or imbalance of weight, force, state, quantity, etc. Expresses stability, equality, offset, equilibrium.
    - **KO-EN Translational Application:** Mapped to related English conceptual terms and expressions like *balance*, *equilibrium*, *be equal*, *offset*, *overwhelm*. Korean expressions like '균형을 잡다' directly convey this.

- **8. LINK Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** Represents that two or more entities are physically, abstractly, or logically connected. Expresses relationships, dependency, causality, affiliation.
    - **KO-EN Translational Application:** Mapped to various English connection/relationship expressions like *connect*, *be related to*, *depend on*, *cause*. Korean particles (e.g., ~와/과, ~에) often imply these links.

- **9. PART-WHOLE Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** The relationship between a whole and its constituent parts. Conceptualizes elements forming a whole, possession, affiliation, composition.
    - **KO-EN Translational Application:** Mapped to English part-whole relationship expressions like *part of*, *constitute*, *belong to*, *component*. Korean expressions like '~의 일부', '~으로 구성되다' are direct applications.

- **10. CENTER-PERIPHERY Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** Conceptualizes the relationship between a center and its periphery. Used to express core, importance, focus, peripheral elements.
    - **KO-EN Translational Application:** Mapped to related English conceptual terms like *core*, *center*, *periphery*, *outskirts*, *important/unimportant*, *focus*.

- **11. FRONT-BACK Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** A schema conceptualizing spatial front-back relationships, temporal sequence (past-future), or order of importance.
    - **KO-EN Translational Application:** Mapped to English front-back expressions like *in front of/behind*, *before/after*, *leader/follower*, *priority*. Korean terms like '앞', '뒤' are directly correlated.

- **12. NEAR-FAR Schema**
    - **Cognitive Meaning:** Conceptualizes physical or psychological distance. Used to express intimacy, relevance, importance, temporal proximity.
    - **KO-EN Translational Application:** Mapped to English near-far/distance concepts like *near/far*, *get closer/further*, *intimate/distant*. Korean expressions such as '가깝다', '멀다' are direct applications.

## 4. Linguistic Expression and Cognitive Perspective (Extension & Elaboration)
- **Extension & Elaboration:** The phenomenon where basic schemas or concepts are extended or modified in new contexts. (e.g., physical '포함하다' (to contain) extending to '정보를 포함하다' (to contain information))
    - **KO-EN Translational Implications:** Identify the cognitive origin of metaphorical/abstract expressions in Korean to re-conceptualize them into the most natural metaphor or abstract expression in the target language (English). This often involves converting Korean nominalizations or verb-ending nuances into English equivalents.

## 5. Significance and Importance of Cognitive Grammar in KO-EN Translation Application
- Korean-to-English translation is not merely changing vocabulary or grammar, but a 'conceptual interpretation' process that deeply understands the cognitive conceptualization, speaker's perspective, and embedded schemas of the Korean source text, and then expresses them by re-conceptualizing in the most natural and appropriate way in the target language (English).
- Especially when language structures (word order, grammar, ways of extending meaning of vocabulary) differ significantly, like between Korean and English, preserving cognitive schemas and perspectives beyond surface translation, and transforming them to suit the target language, is key to translation quality. This includes handling Korean specificities like subject omission, honorifics, and various particles naturally in English.
