# Cultural Nuance and Emotion Reflection Translation Guidelines

## 1. Adjusting Intensity and Style of Emotion/Sentiment Expression
- **Cultural Differences:** Western cultures (English) tend to express emotions relatively directly, while Korean culture often expresses emotions indirectly or with restraint.
- **Translation Guide:**
  - **Intensity Adjustment:** When translating intense emotional expressions from the source text (e.g., "absolutely furious") directly into Korean, it may sound awkward or exaggerated. Therefore, adjust the intensity appropriately to suit Korean culture.
    - Example: "I'm **absolutely furious** about this!" -> "이 일에 대해 정말 **화가 납니다**." (Avoid exaggerated expressions)
  - **Indirect Expression:** Instead of directly exposing emotions, translate in a way that allows emotions to be inferred through situational descriptions or actions.
    - Example: "He was **heartbroken**." -> "그는 **마음이 찢어지는 듯했다**." (Utilize metaphorical expressions)
  - **Honorifics/Plain Speech:** Korean honorifics/plain speech indicate the depth of emotion and relationships, so apply them appropriately after identifying the relationships in the original text.

## 2. Reinterpretation of Humor/Satire/Metaphor
- **Cultural Specificity:** Humor, satire, and metaphors heavily rely on cultural background knowledge and wordplay, so direct translation may lead to loss of meaning or misunderstanding.
- **Translation Guide:**
  - **Maintain Concept, Transform Expression:** Understand the 'concept' or 'punchline' intended by the humor in the original text and 're-interpret' it into other humorous or metaphorical expressions that can achieve a similar effect in Korean culture.
  - **Add Explanations/Footnotes (Optional):** If direct translation is unavoidable, or if understanding is difficult without cultural background, a brief explanation can be added in parentheses or a footnote can be used to explain the context of the original text.
  - **Proverbs/Idioms:** Replace English proverbs or idioms with similar Korean proverbs or idioms. If there is no corresponding expression, explain its meaning.
    - Example: "It's raining **cats and dogs**." -> "비가 **억수같이** 온다."
    - Example: "Break a leg!" -> "**행운을 빌어**!" (Direct translation 'break a leg' is awkward)

## 3. Handling Cultural Proper Nouns/Concepts
- **Handling Methods:** People, places, institutions, foods, events, etc., specific to a certain culture may be difficult or unnecessary to translate directly.
- **Translation Guide:**
  - **Transliteration:** Proper nouns are generally transliterated to sound similar to their original pronunciation.
  - **Add Explanation:** If necessary, add a brief explanation in parentheses after transliteration to aid understanding.
  - **Substitution:** If a specific concept has a similar expression in Korean, it can be substituted, but be careful not to distort the meaning.
    - Example: "Thanksgiving Day" -> "추수감사절" (Substitution)
    - Example: "baseball" -> "야구" (Transliteration + Substitution)
    - Example: "Ivy League" -> "아이비리그 (미국 북동부 8개 명문 사립대)" (Transliteration + Explanation)

## 4. Maintaining Speaker/Listener Relationship and Tone/Style
- **Korean Honorifics:** Korean has developed honorifics (honorifics, humble speech) that clearly reveal the relationship between the speaker, listener, and subject.
- **Translation Guide:**
  - **Identify Relationship:** Identify the relationship in which the original text was written (friends, colleagues, superiors, customers, etc.) and apply the appropriate Korean honorifics or plain speech.
  - **Formal/Informal:** Maintain a formal style for official documents or presentations, and a friendly or light style for informal conversations or casual content.
  - **Speaker's Intent:** Accurately identify the speaker's intent, such as gratitude, apology, command, request, suggestion, and use expressions that most clearly convey that intent in Korean.

## 5. Awareness of Cultural Bias
- **Translation Guide:** If there is potential cultural bias or stereotypes embedded in the source text, recognize them and take care not to amplify them or offend the target culture during the translation process. If necessary, choose neutral expressions.
