운수 좋은날

현진건

 새침하게 흐린 품이 눈이 올 듯하더니 눈은 아니 오고 얼다가 만 비가 추
적추적 내리는 날이었다.
 이날이야말로 동소문 안에서 인력거꾼 노릇을 하는 김첨지에게는 오래간만
에도 닥친 운수 좋은 날이었다. 문안에(거기도 문밖은 아니지만) 들어간답
시는 앞집 마마님을 전찻길까지 모셔다 드린 것을 비롯으로 행여나 손님이
있을까 하고 정류장에서 어정어정하며 내리는 사람 하나하나에게 거의 비는
듯한 눈결을 보내고 있다가 마침내 교원인 듯한 양복쟁이를 동광학교(東光
學校)까지 태워다 주기로 되었다.
 첫 번에 삼십전 , 둘째 번에 오십전 - 아침 댓바람에 그리 흉치 않은 일이
었다. 그야말로 재수가 옴붙어서 근 열흘 동안 돈 구경도 못한 김첨지는 십
전짜리 백동화 서 푼, 또는 다섯 푼이 찰깍 하고 손바닥에 떨어질 제 거의
눈물을 흘릴 만큼 기뻤었다. 더구나 이날 이때에 이 팔십 전이라는 돈이 그
에게 얼마나 유용한지 몰랐다. 컬컬한 목에 모주 한 잔도 적실 수 있거니와
그보다도 앓는 아내에게 설렁탕 한 그릇도 사다 줄 수 있음이다.
 그의 아내가 기침으로 쿨룩거리기는 벌써 달포가 넘었다. 조밥도 굶기를
먹다시피 하는 형편이니 물론 약 한 첩 써본 일이 없다. 구태여 쓰려면 못
쓸 바도 아니로되 그는 병이란 놈에게 약을 주어 보내면 재미를 붙여서 자
꾸 온다는 자기의 신조(信條)에 어디까지 충실하였다. 따라서 의사에게 보
인 적이 없으니 무슨 병인지는 알 수 없으되 반듯이 누워 가지고 일어나기
는 새로 모로도 못 눕는 걸 보면 중증은 중증인 듯. 병이 이대도록 심해지
기는 열흘전에 조밥을 먹고 체한 때문이다. 그때도 김첨지가 오래간만에 돈
을 얻어서 좁쌀 한 되와 십 전짜리 나무 한 단을 사다 주었더니 김첨지의
말에 의지하면 그 오라질 년이 천방지축으로 냄비에 대고 끓였다. 마음은
급하고 불길은 달지 않아 채 익지도 않은 것을 그 오라질년이 숟가락은 고
만두고 손으로 움켜서 두 뺨에 주먹덩이 같은 혹이 불거지도록 누가 빼앗을
듯이 처박질하더니만 그날 저녁부터 가슴이 땡긴다, 배가 켕긴다고 눈을 흡
뜨고 지랄병을 하였다. 그때 김첨지는 열화와 같이 성을 내며,
  “에이, 오라질년, 조랑복은 할 수가 없어, 못 먹어 병, 먹어서 병! 어쩌
란 말이야! 왜 눈을 바루 뜨지 못해!”
하고 앓는 이의 뺨을 한 번 후려갈겼다. 흡뜬 눈은 조금 바루어졌건만 이슬
이 맺히었다. 김첨지의 눈시울도 뜨끈뜨끈하였다.
 이 환자가 그러고도 먹는 데는 물리지 않았다. 사흘 전부터 설렁탕 국물이
마시고 싶다고 남편을 졸랐다.
  “이런 오라질 년! 조밥도 못 먹는 년이 설렁탕은. 또 처먹고 지랄병을 하
게.”
라고, 야단을 쳐보았건만, 못 사주는 마음이 시원치는 않았다.
 인제 설렁탕을 사줄 수도 있다. 앓는 어미 곁에서 배고파 보채는 개똥이
(세살먹이)에게 죽을 사줄 수도 있다 - 팔십 전을 손에 쥔 김 첨지의 마음
은 푼푼하였다.
 그러나 그의 행운은 그걸로 그치지 않았다. 땀과 빗물이 섞여 흐르는 목덜
미를 기름주머니가 다된 왜목 수건으로 닦으며, 그 학교 문을 돌아 나올 때
였다. 뒤에서 “인력거!” 하고 부르는 소리가 난다. 자기를 불러 멈춘 사
람이 그 학교 학생인 줄 김첨지는 한번 보고 짐작할 수 있었다. 그 학생은
다짜고짜로,
  “남대문 정거장까지 얼마요.”
라고 물었다. 아마도 그 학교 기숙사에 있는 이로 동기방학을 이용하여 귀
향하려 함이리라. 오늘 가기로 작정은 하였건만 비는 오고, 짐은 있고 해서
어찌할 줄 모르다가 마침 김첨지를 보고 뛰어나왔음이리라. 그렇지 않으면
왜 구두를 채 신지 못해서 질질 끌고, 비록 고구라 양복일망정 노박이로 비
를 맞으며 김첨지를 뒤쫓아 나왔으랴.
  “남대문 정거장까지 말씀입니까.”
하고 김첨지는 잠깐 주저하였다. 그는 이 우중에 우장도 없이 그 먼 곳을
철벅거리고 가기가 싫었음일까? 처음 것 둘째 것으로 고만 만족하였음일까?
아니다 결코 아니다. 이상하게도 꼬리를 맞물고 덤비는 이 행운 앞에 조금
겁이 났음이다. 그리고 집을 나올 제 아내의 부탁이 마음이 켕기었다 - 앞
집 마마님한테서 부르러 왔을 제 병인은 뼈만 남은 얼굴에 유일의 샘물 같
은 유달리 크고 움푹한 눈에 애걸하는 빛을 띄우며,
  “오늘은 나가지 말아요. 제발 덕분에 집에 붙어 있어요. 내가 이렇게 아
픈데…….”
라고, 모기 소리같이 중얼거리고 숨을 걸그렁걸그렁하였다. 그때에 김첨지
는 대수롭지 않은듯이,
  “아따, 젠장맞을 년, 별 빌어먹을 소리를 다 하네. 맞붙들고 앉았으면 누
가 먹여 살릴 줄 알아.”
하고 훌쩍 뛰어나오려니까 환자는 붙잡을 듯이 팔을 내저으며,
  “나가지 말라도 그래, 그러면 일찍이 들어와요.”
하고, 목메인 소리가 뒤를 따랐다.
 정거장까지 가잔 말을 들은 순간에 경련적으로 떠는 손 유달리 큼직한 눈
울 듯한 아내의 얼굴이 김첨지의 눈앞에 어른어른하였다.
  “그래 남대문 정거장까지 얼마란 말이요?”
하고 학생은 초조한 듯이 인력거꾼의 얼굴을 바라보며 혼자말같이,
  “인천 차가 열한 점에 있고 그 다음에는 새로 두 점이든가.”
라고 중얼거린다.
  “일 원 오십 전만 줍시요.”
 이 말이 저도 모를 사이에 불쑥 김첨지의 입에서 떨어졌다. 제 입으로 부
르고도 스스로 그 엄청난 돈 액수에 놀랐다. 한꺼번에 이런 금액을 불러라
도 본 지가 그 얼마 만인가! 그러자 그 돈벌 용기가 병자에 대한 염려를 사
르고 말았다. 설마 오늘 내로 어떠랴 싶었다. 무슨 일이 있더라도 제일 제
이의 행운을 곱친 것보다고 오히려 갑절이 많은 이 행운을 놓칠 수 없다 하
였다.
  “일 원 오십 전은 너무 과한데.”
이런 말을 하며 학생은 고개를 기웃하였다.
  “아니올시다. 잇수로 치면 여기서 거기가 시오 리가 넘는답니다. 또 이런
진날은 좀 더 주셔야지요.”
하고 빙글빙글 웃는 차부의 얼굴에는 숨길 수 없는 기쁨이 넘쳐흘렀다.
  “그러면 달라는 대로 줄 터이니 빨리 가요.”
 관대한 어린 손님은 이런 말을 남기고 총총히 옷도 입고 짐도 챙기러 갈
데로 갔다.
 그 학생을 태우고 나선 김첨지의 다리는 이상하게 거뿐하였다. 달음질을
한다느니보다 거의 나는 듯하였다. 바퀴도 어떻게 속히 도는지 구른다느니
보다 마치 얼음을 지쳐 나가는 스케이트 모양으로 미끄러져 가는 듯하였다.
언 땅에 비가 내려 미끄럽기도 하였지만.
 이윽고 끄는 이의 다리는 무거워졌다. 자기 집 가까이 다다른 까닭이다.
새삼스러운 염려가 그의 가슴을 눌렀다. “오늘은 나가지 말아요, 내가 이
렇게 아픈데” 이런 말이 잉잉 그의 귀에 울렸다. 그리고 병자의 움쑥 들어
간 눈이 원망하는 듯이 자기를 노리는 듯하였다. 그러자 엉엉 하고 우는 개
똥이의 곡성을 들은 듯싶다. 딸국딸국 하고 숨 모으는 소리도 나는 듯싶다.
  “왜 이리우, 기차 놓치겠구먼.”
하고 탄 이의 초조한 부르짖음이 간신히 그의 귀에 들어왔다. 언뜻 깨달으
니 김첨지는 인력거를 쥔 채 길 한복판에 엉거주춤 멈춰 있지 않은가.
  “예, 예.”
하고, 김첨지는 또다시 달음질하였다. 집이 차차 멀어 갈수록 김첨지의 걸
음에는 다시금 신이 나기 시작하였다. 다리를 재게 놀려야만 쉴새없이 자기
의 머리에 떠오르는 모든 근심과 걱정을 잊을 듯이.
 정거장까지 끌어다 주고 그 깜짝 놀란 일 원 오십 전을 정말 제 손에 쥠에
제 말마따나 십리나 되는 길을 비를 맞아 가며 질퍽거리고 온 생각은 아니
하고 거저나 얻은 듯이 고마웠다. 졸부나 된 듯이 기뻤다. 제 자식뻘밖에
안 되는 어린 손님에게 몇 번 허리를 굽히며,
  “안녕히 다녀옵시요.”
라고 깍듯이 재우쳤다.
 그러나 빈 인력거를 털털거리며 이 우중에 돌아갈 일이 꿈밖이었다. 노동
으로 하여 흐른 땀이 식어지자 굶주린 창자에서, 물 흐르는 옷에서 어슬어
슬 한기가 솟아나기 비롯하매 일 원 오십 전이란 돈이 얼마나 괜찮고 괴로
운 것인 줄 절절히 느끼었다. 정거장을 떠나는 그의 발길은 힘 하나 없었
다. 온몸이 옹송그려지며 당장 그 자리에 엎어져 못 일어날 것 같았다.
  “젠장맞을 것, 이 비를 맞으며 빈 인력거를 털털거리고 돌아를 간담. 이
런 빌어먹을 제 할미를 붙을 비가 왜 남의 상판을 딱딱 때려!”
 그는 몹시 화증을 내며 누구에게 반항이나 하는 듯이 게걸거렸다. 그럴 즈
음에 그의 머리엔 또 새로운 광명이 비쳤나니 그것은  ‘이러구 갈 게 아니
라 이 근처를 빙빙 돌며 차 오기를 기다리면 또 손님을 태우게 될는지도 몰
라’  란 생각이었다. 오늘 운수가 괴상하게도 좋으니까 그런 요행이 또 한번
없으리라고 누가 보증하랴. 꼬리를 굴리는 행운이 꼭 자기를 기다리고 있다
고 내기를 해도 좋을 만한 믿음을 얻게 되었다. 그렇다고 정거장 인력거꾼
의 등쌀이 무서우니 정거장 앞에 섰을 수는 없었다. 그래 그는 이전에도 여
러 번 해본 일이라 바로 정거장 앞 전차 정류장에서 조금 떨어지게 사람 다
니는 길과 전찻길 틈에 인력거를 세워 놓고 자기는 그 근처를 빙빙 돌며 형
세를 관망하기로 하였다. 얼마 만에 기차는 왔고 수십 명이나 되는 손이 정
류장으로 쏟아져 나왔다. 그 중에서 손님을 물색하는 김첨지의 눈엔 양머리
에 뒤축 높은 구두를 신고 망토까지 두른 기생 퇴물인 듯 난봉 여학생인 듯
한 여편네의 모양이 띄었다. 그는 슬근슬근 그 여자의 곁으로 다가들었다.
  “아씨, 인력거 아니 타시랍시요.”
 그 여학생인지 만지가 한참은 매우 때깔을 빼며 입술을 꼭 다문 채 김첨지
를 거들떠보지도 않았다. 김첨지는 구걸하는 거지나 무엇같이 연해연방 그
의 기색을 살피며,
  “아씨, 정거장 애들보담 아주 싸게 모셔다 드리겠습니다. 댁이 어디신가
요.”
하고 추근추근하게도 그 여자의 들고 있는 일본식 버들고리짝에 제 손을 대
었다.
  “왜 이래, 남 귀치않게.”
 소리를 벽력같이 지르고는 돌아선다. 김첨지는 어랍시요 하고 물러섰다.
 전차는 왔다. 김첨지는 원망스럽게 전차 타는 이를 노리고 있었다. 그러나
그의 예감(豫感)은 틀리지 않았다. 전차가 빡빡하게 사람을 싣고 움직이기
시작하였을 제 타고 남은 손 하나가 있었다. 굉장하게 큰 가방을 들고 있는
걸 보면 아마 붐비는 차 안에 짐이 크다 하여 차장에게 밀려 내려온 눈치였
다. 김첨지는 대어섰다.
  “인력거를 타시랍시요.”
 한동안 값으로 승강이를 하다가 육십 전에 인사동까지 태워다 주기로 하였
다. 인력거가 무거워지매 그의 몸은 이상하게도 가벼워졌고 그리고 또 인력
거가 가벼워지니 몸은 다시금 무거워졌건만 이번에는 마음조차 초조해 온
다. 집의 광경이 자꾸 눈앞에 어른거리어 인제 요행을 바랄 여유도 없었다.
나무 등걸이나 무엇 같고 제 것 같지도 않은 다리를 연해 꾸짖으며 질팡갈
팡 뛰는 수밖에 없었다. 저놈의 인력거꾼이 저렇게 술이 취해 가지고 이 진
땅에 어찌 가노, 라고 길 가는 사람이 걱정을 하리만큼 그의 걸음은 황급하
였다. 흐리고 비 오는 하늘은 어둠침침하게 벌써 황혼에 가까운 듯하다. 창
경원 앞까지 다다라서야 그는 턱에 닿은 숨을 돌리고 걸음도 늦추잡았다.
한 걸음 두 걸음 집이 가까워 갈수록 그의 마음조차 괴상하게 누그러웠다.
그런데 이 누그러움은 안심에서 오는 게 아니요 자기를 덮친 무서운 불행을
빈틈없이 알게 될 때가 박두한 것을 두리는 마음에서 오는 것이다. 그는 불
행에 다닥치기 전 시간을 얼마쯤이라도 늘이려고 버르적거렸다. 기적(奇蹟)
에 가까운 벌이를 하였다는 기쁨을 할 수 있으면 오래 지니고 싶었다. 그는
두리번두리번 사면을 살피었다. 그 모양은 마치 자기 집 ― 곧 불행을 향하
고 달아가는 제 다리를 제 힘으로는 도저히 어찌할 수 없으니 누구든지 나
를 좀 잡아 다고, 구해 다고 하는 듯하였다.
 그럴 즈음에 마침 길가 선술집에서 그의 친구 치삼이가 나온다. 그의 우글
우글 살찐 얼굴에 주홍이 덧는 듯, 온 턱과 뺨을 시커멓게 구레나룻이 덮였
거늘 노르탱탱한 얼굴이 바짝 말라서 여기저기 고랑이 패고 수염도 있대야
턱밑에만 마치 솔잎 송이를 거꾸로 붙여 놓은 듯한 김첨지의 풍채하고는 기
이한 대상을 짓고 있었다.
  “여보게 김첨지, 자네 문안 들어갔다 오는 모양일세그려. 돈 많이 벌었을
테니 한잔 빨리게.”
 뚱뚱보는 말라깽이를 보던 맡에 부르짖었다. 그 목소리는 몸집과 딴판으로
연하고 싹싹하였다. 김첨지는 이 친구를 만난 게 어떻게 반가운지 몰랐다.
자기를 살려 준 은인이나 무엇같이 고맙기도 하였다.
  “자네는 벌써 한잔한 모양일세그려. 자네도 오늘 재미가 좋아 보이.”
하고 김첨지는 얼굴을 펴서 웃었다.
  “아따, 재미 안 좋다고 술 못 먹을 낸가. 그런데 여보게, 자네 왼몸이 어
째 물독에 빠진 새앙쥐 같은가. 어서 이리 들어와 말리게.”
 선술집은 훈훈하고 뜨뜻하였다. 추어탕을 끓이는 솥뚜껑을 열 적마다 뭉게
뭉게 떠오르는 흰김 석쇠에서 뻐지짓뻐지짓 구워지는 너비아니구이며 제육
이며 간이며 콩팥이며 북어며 빈대떡……이 너저분하게 늘어놓인 안주 탁자
에 김첨지는 갑자기 속이 쓰려서 견딜 수 없었다. 마음대로 할 양이면 거기
있는 모든 먹음먹이를 모조리 깡그리 집어삼켜도 시원치 않았다 하되 배고
픈 이는 위선 분량 많은 빈대떡 두 개를 쪼이기도 하고 추어탕을 한 그릇
청하였다. 주린 창자는 음식맛을 보더니 더욱더욱 비어지며 자꾸자꾸 들이
라 들이라 하였다. 순식간에 두부와 미꾸리 든 국 한 그릇을 그냥 물같이
들이켜고 말았다. 셋째 그릇을 받아 들었을 제 데우던 막걸리 곱배기 두 잔
이 더웠다. 치삼이와 같이 마시자 원원이 비었던 속이라 찌르를 하고 창자
에 퍼지며 얼굴이 화끈하였다. 눌러 곱배기 한 잔을 또 마셨다.
 김첨지의 눈은 벌써 개개 풀리기 시작하였다. 석쇠에 얹힌 떡 두 개를 숭
덩숭덩 썰어서 볼을 불룩거리며 또 곱배기 두 잔을 부어라 하였다.
 치삼은 의아한 듯이 김첨지를 보며,
  “여보게 또 붓다니, 벌써 우리가 넉 잔씩 먹었네, 돈이 사십 전일세.”
라고 주의시켰다.
  “아따 이놈아, 사십 전이 그리 끔찍하냐. 오늘 내가 돈을 막 벌었어. 참
오늘 운수가 좋았느니.”
  “그래 얼마를 벌었단 말인가.”
  “삼십 원을 벌었어, 삼십 원을! 이런 젠장맞을 술을 왜 안 부어…… 괜찮
다 괜찮다, 막 먹어도 상관이 없어. 오늘 돈 산더미같이 벌었는데.”
  “어, 이 사람 취했군, 그만두세.”
  “이놈아, 그걸 먹고 취할 내냐, 어서 더 먹어.”
하고는 치삼의 귀를 잡아 치며 취한 이는 부르짖었다. 그리고 술을 붓는 열
다섯 살 됨직한 중대가리에게로 달려들며,
  “이놈, 오라질 놈, 왜 술을 붓지 않어.”
라고 야단을 쳤다. 중대가리는 희희 웃고 치삼을 보며 문의하는 듯이 눈짓
을 하였다. 주정꾼이 이 눈치를 알아보고 화를 버럭 내며,
  “에미를 붙을 이 오라질 놈들 같으니, 이놈 내가 돈이 없을 줄 알고.”
하자마자 허리춤을 훔칫훔칫하더니 일 원짜리 한 장을 꺼내어 중대가리 앞
에 펄쩍 집어던졌다. 그 사품에 몇 푼 은전이 잘그랑 하며 떨어진다.
  “여보게 돈 떨어졌네, 왜 돈을 막 끼얹나.”
 이런 말을 하며 일변 돈을 줍는다. 김첨지는 취한 중에도 돈의 거처를 살
피는 듯이 눈을 크게 떠서 땅을 내려다보다가 불시에 제 하는 짓이 너무 더
럽다는 듯이 고개를 소스라치자 더욱 성을 내며,
  “봐라 봐! 이 더러운 놈들아, 내가 돈이 없나, 다리뼉다구를 꺾어 놓을
놈들 같으니.”
하고 치삼의 주워 주는 돈을 받아,
  “이 원수엣돈! 이 육시를 할 돈!”
하면서 풀매질을 친다. 벽에 맞아 떨어진 돈은 다시 술 끓이는 양푼에 떨어
지며 정당한 매를 맞는다는 듯이 쨍 하고 울었다.
 곱배기 두 잔은 또 부어질 겨를도 없이 말려 가고 말았다. 김첨지는 입술
과 수염에 붙은 술을 빨아들이고 나서 매우 만족한 듯이 그 솔잎 송이 수염
을 쓰다듬으며,
  “또 부어, 또 부어.”
라고 외쳤다.
 또 한 잔 먹고 나서 김첨지는 치삼의 어깨를 치며 문득 껄껄 웃는다. 그
웃음 소리가 어떻게 컸던지 술집에 있는 이의 눈은 모두 김첨지에게로 몰리
었다. 웃는 이는 더욱 웃으며,
  “여보게 치삼이, 내 우스운 이야기 하나 할까. 오늘 손을 태고 정거장에
가지 않았겠나.”
  “그래서.”
  “갔다가 그저 오기가 안됐데그려. 그래 전차 정류장에서 어름어름하며 손
님 하나를 태울 궁리를 하지 않았나. 거기 마침 마마님이신지 여학생이신지
(요새야 어디 논다니와 아가씨를 구별할 수가 있던가) 망토를 잡수시고 비
를 맞고 서 있겠지. 슬근슬근 가까이 가서 인력거 타시랍시요 하고 손가방
을 받으랴니까 내 손을 탁 뿌리치고 홱 돌아서더니만  ‘왜 남을 이렇게 귀
찮게 굴어!’   그 소리야말로 꾀꼬리 소리지, 허허!”
 김첨지는 교묘하게도 정말 꾀꼬리 같은 소리를 내었다. 모든 사람은 일시
에 웃었다.
  “빌어먹을 깍쟁이 같은 년, 누가 저를 어쩌나,   ‘왜 남을 귀찮게 굴어!’
어이구 소리가 처신도 없지, 허허.”
 웃음 소리들은 높아졌다. 그러나 그 웃음 소리들이 사라도 지기 전에 김첨
지는 훌쩍훌쩍 울기 시작하였다.
 치삼은 어이없이 주정뱅이를 바라보며,
  “금방 웃고 지랄을 하더니 우는 건 또 무슨 일인가.”
 김첨지는 연해 코를 들이마시며,
  “우리 마누라가 죽었다네.”
  “뭐, 마누라가 죽다니, 언제?”
  “이놈아 언제는, 오늘이지.”
  “엣기 미친놈, 거짓말 말아.”
  “거짓말은 왜, 참말로 죽었어, 참말로…… 마누라 시체를 집에 뻐들쳐 놓
고 내가 술을 먹다니, 내가 죽일 놈이야, 죽일 놈이야.”
하고 김첨지는 엉엉 소리를 내어 운다.
 치삼은 흥이 조금 깨어지는 얼굴로,
  “원 이 사람이, 참말을 하나 거짓말을 하나. 그러면 집으로 가세, 가.”
하고 우는 이의 팔을 잡아당기었다.
 치삼의 끄는 손을 뿌리치더니 김첨지는 눈물이 글썽글썽한 눈으로 싱그레
웃는다.
  “죽기는 누가 죽어.”
하고 득의가 양양.
  “죽기는 왜 죽어, 생때같이 살아만 있단다. 그 오라질 년이 밥을 죽이지.
인제 나한테 속았다.”
하고 어린애 모양으로 손뼉을 치며 웃는다.
  “이 사람이 정말 미쳤단 말인가. 나도 아주먼네가 앓는단 말은 들었는
데.”
하고 치삼이도 어느 불안을 느끼는 듯이 김첨지에게 또 돌아가라고 권하였
다.
  “안 죽었어, 안 죽었대도 그래.”
 김첨지는 화증을 내며 확신 있게 소리를 질렀으되 그 소리엔 안 죽은 것을
믿으려고 애쓰는 가락이 있었다. 기어이 일 원 어치를 채워서 곱배기 한 잔
씩 더 먹고 나왔다. 궂은비는 의연히 추적추적 내린다.
 김첨지는 취중에도 설렁탕을 사가지고 집에 다다랐다. 집이라 해도 물론
셋집이요 또 집 전체를 세든 게 아니라 안과 뚝 떨어진 행랑방 한 간을 빌
려 든 것인데 물을 길어 대고 한 달에 일 원씩 내는 터이다. 만일 김첨지가
주기를 띠지 않았던들 한 발을 대문에 들여놓았을 제 그곳을 지배하는 무시
무시한 정적(靜寂) ― 폭풍우가 지나간 뒤의 바다 같은 정적이 다리가 떨렸
으리라. 쿨룩거리는 기침 소리도 들을 수 없다. 그르렁거리는 숨소리조차
들을 수 없다. 다만 이 무덤 같은 침묵을 깨뜨리는 ― 깨뜨린다느니보다 한
층 더 침묵을 깊게 하고 불길하게 하는 빡빡 하는 그윽한 소리, 어린애의
젖 빠는 소리가 날 뿐이다. 만일 청각(聽覺)이 예민한 이 같으면 그 빡빡
소리는 빨 따름이요, 꿀떡꿀떡 하고 젖 넘어가는 소리가 없으니 빈 젖을 빤
다는 것도 짐작할는지 모르리라.
 혹은 김첨지도 이 불길한 침묵을 짐작했는지도 모른다. 그렇지 않으면 대
문에 들어서자마자 전에 없이,
  “이 난장맞을 년, 남편이 들어오는데 나와 보지도 않아, 이 오라질 년.”
이라고 고함을 친 게 수상하다. 이 고함이야말로 제 몸을 엄습해 오는 무시
무시한 증을 쫓아 버리려는 허장성세인 까닭이다.
 하여간 김첨지는 방문을 왈칵 열었다. 구역을 나게 하는 추기 ― 떨어진
삿자리 밑에서 나온 먼지내 빨지 않은 기저귀에서 나는 똥내와 오줌내 가지
각색 때가 켜켜이 앉은 옷내 병인의 땀 썩은 내가 섞인 추기가 무딘 김첨지
의 코를 찔렀다.
 방 안에 들어서며 설렁탕을 한구석에 놓을 사이도 없이 주정꾼은 목청을
있는 대로 다 내어 호통을 쳤다.
  “이런 오라질 년, 주야장천 누워만 있으면 제일이야. 남편이 와도 일어나
지를 못해.”
라는 소리와 함께 발길로 누운 이의 다리를 몹시 찼다. 그러나 발길에 채이
는 건 사람의 살이 아니고 나무등걸과 같은 느낌이 있었다. 이때에 빽빽 소
리가 응아 소리로 변하였다. 개똥이가 물었던 젖을 빼어 놓고 운다. 운대도
온 얼굴을 찡그려 붙여서 운다는 표정을 할 뿐이다. 응아 소리도 입에서 나
는 게 아니고 마치 뱃속에서 나는 듯하였다. 울다가 울다가 목도 잠겼고 또
울 기운조차 시진한 것 같다.
 발로 차도 그 보람이 없는 걸 보자 남편은 아내의 머리맡으로 달려들어 그
야말로 까치집 같은 환자의 머리를 꺼들어 흔들며,
  “이년아, 말을 해, 말을! 입이 붙었어, 이 오라질 년!”
  “……”
  “으응, 이것 봐, 아무 말이 없네.”
  “……”
  “이년아, 죽었단 말이냐, 왜 말이 없어.”
  “……”
  “으응, 또 대답이 없네. 정말 죽었나 버이.”
이러다가 누운 이의 흰 창을 덮은 위로 치뜬 눈을 알아보자마자,
  “이 눈깔! 이 눈깔! 왜 나를 바라보지 못하고 천장만 보느냐, 응.”
하는 말 끝엔 목이 메였다. 그러자 산 사람의 눈에서 떨어진 닭의 똥 같은

## A Lucky Day

**Hyun Jin-geon**

It was a chilly, overcast day, looking as if it might snow, but instead, a cold, half-frozen rain fell steadily.

Today was, for Kim Cheomji, a rickshaw puller living inside Dongsomun Gate, a lucky day he hadn't seen in a long time. Beginning with escorting the madam from the house across the street (which, though inside the gate, wasn't far from the outside) to the tram line, he then lingered at the station, casting begging glances at every person who alighted, hoping for a fare. Finally, he got a gentleman in Western clothes, who seemed to be a teacher, to take him to Donggwang School.

Thirty jeon for the first fare, fifty jeon for the second—not bad at all for early morning. Kim Cheomji, who had been cursed with bad luck and hadn't seen a coin in nearly ten days, was so happy when three or five 10-jeon brass coins clinked into his palm that he almost cried. Moreover, he couldn't have known how useful this eighty jeon would be to him at this very moment. He could wet his parched throat with a cup of *moju*, but more importantly, he could buy a bowl of *seolleongtang* for his ailing wife.

His wife had been coughing for over a month now. Given their situation, often going without even millet rice, she had, of course, never taken a single dose of medicine. He could have afforded it if he'd truly wanted to, but he strictly adhered to his belief that if you give medicine to an illness, it gets used to it and keeps coming back. Consequently, he had never shown her to a doctor, so he didn't know what her illness was. But seeing her lying flat on her back, unable to even turn over, it seemed serious. Her illness had worsened ten days ago after she got indigestion from eating millet rice. At that time, Kim Cheomji had, after a long while, earned some money and bought a pound of millet and a 10-jeon bundle of firewood. According to Kim Cheomji, that damned woman cooked it like a madwoman in the pot. She was in a hurry, and the fire wasn't hot enough, so she ate it half-cooked. That damned woman, instead of using a spoon, grabbed it with her hands and stuffed it in, as if someone would snatch it away, until her cheeks bulged like fists. From that evening, she complained of chest pain and stomach cramps, flailing about with wide, staring eyes. Kim Cheomji, furious, yelled,

"Aish, you damned woman! There's no escaping this bad luck. Sick from not eating, sick from eating! What am I supposed to do? Why can't you open your eyes properly!"

And he slapped the sick woman's cheek. Her staring eyes straightened a little, but tears welled up. Kim Cheomji's eyes also felt hot.

Even after that, the patient didn't lose her appetite. Three days ago, she had begged her husband for *seolleongtang* broth.

"This damned woman! You can't even eat millet rice, and now *seolleongtang*? Are you going to eat it and get sick again?"

He scolded her, but he felt uneasy about not being able to buy it for her.

Now, he could buy *seolleongtang*. He could also buy porridge for Gaettongi (three years old), who was hungry and crying beside his ailing mother. Kim Cheomji, with eighty jeon in his hand, felt generous.

However, his good fortune didn't end there. It was when he was wiping his neck, where sweat and rainwater mingled, with his oil-stained Japanese towel, as he came out of the school gate. A voice from behind called, "Rickshaw!" Kim Cheomji could tell at a glance that the person who stopped him was a student from that school. The student abruptly asked,

"How much to Namdaemun Station?"

Perhaps he was staying in the school dormitory and was going home for winter break. He had decided to leave today, but with the rain and his luggage, he didn't know what to do until he saw Kim Cheomji and rushed out. Otherwise, why would he be dragging his unlaced shoes, and even if it was a cheap Western suit, why would he be running after Kim Cheomji, getting soaked in the rain?

"To Namdaemun Station, you say?"

Kim Cheomji hesitated for a moment. Was it because he didn't want to trudge through the long distance in this rain without rain gear? Or was he satisfied with the first two fares? No, absolutely not. He was strangely afraid of this good fortune that kept coming in succession. And his wife's request as he left the house weighed on his mind—when the madam from the house across the street came to call him, the sick woman, with her skeletal face and uniquely large, sunken eyes, like the only spring water left, pleaded,

"Please don't go out today. Please stay home. I'm so sick..."

She mumbled like a mosquito, her breathing rattling. At that time, Kim Cheomji, as if it were nothing, said,

"Aish, you damned woman, you're saying all sorts of nonsense. Who's going to feed us if I sit around with you?"

And as he was about to jump out, the patient waved her arm as if to grab him, saying,

"I told you not to go out, but if you do, come back early."

Her choked voice followed him.

The moment he heard the words "to the station," his wife's face, with her twitching hands, unusually large eyes, and tearful expression, flickered before Kim Cheomji's eyes.

"So, how much to Namdaemun Station?"

The student asked impatiently, looking at the rickshaw puller's face and muttering to himself,

"The Incheon train is at eleven o'clock, and then the next one is at two, I think?"

"Give me one won and fifty jeon."

This amount blurted out of Kim Cheomji's mouth without him even realizing it. He was surprised by the outrageous sum he himself had named. How long had it been since he had named such a large sum at once! And then, the courage to earn that money burned away his worry for his sick wife. He thought, "Surely nothing will happen today." He decided he couldn't miss this good fortune, which was more than double the first and second lucky fares combined, no matter what.

"One won and fifty jeon is too much."

The student tilted his head, saying this.

"No, sir. By distance, it's over fifteen li from here to there. And on a day like this, you should give a bit more."

Kim Cheomji's face, smiling, overflowed with undisguised joy.

"All right, I'll give you what you ask, so let's go quickly."

The generous young customer said this and hurried off to put on his clothes and pack his luggage.

Kim Cheomji's legs, after taking on the student, felt strangely light. Rather than running, he seemed almost to fly. The wheels spun so fast that they seemed to glide like skates over ice, rather than rolling. Though the frozen ground made it slippery from the rain.

After a while, the puller's legs grew heavy. This was because he was nearing his house. A fresh worry pressed down on his chest. "Please don't go out today, I'm so sick," these words hummed in his ears. And the patient's sunken eyes seemed to glare at him resentfully. Then, he thought he heard Gaettongi's wailing cries, "Eung-eung," and the sound of short, gasping breaths, "ttal-guk-ttal-guk."

"Why are you stopping? We'll miss the train!"

The passenger's impatient shout barely reached his ears. He suddenly realized Kim Cheomji was standing still, hunched over his rickshaw in the middle of the road.

"Yes, yes."

Kim Cheomji began to run again. The further he got from his house, the more invigorated his steps became. As if he had to move his legs quickly to forget all the worries and anxieties that incessantly surfaced in his mind.

After pulling the rickshaw to the station and actually holding the astonishing one won and fifty jeon in his hand, he didn't think about having trudged ten li through the rain and mud; he was just grateful, as if he had received it for free. He was overjoyed, like a nouveau riche. He bowed several times to the young customer, who was barely his son's age, and politely said,

"Have a safe trip."

But the thought of rattling an empty rickshaw back in this pouring rain was beyond him. As the sweat from his labor cooled, and a chilling cold rose from his empty stomach and soaked clothes, he keenly felt how decent, yet painful, one won and fifty jeon was. His steps leaving the station were utterly devoid of strength. His whole body hunched over, as if he might collapse right there and not be able to get up.

"Damn it! To go back rattling an empty rickshaw in this rain. Why is this accursed rain slapping my face like this!"

He grumbled angrily, as if rebelling against someone. Just then, a new light dawned in his mind: 'Instead of going back like this, if I just circle around here and wait for a tram, I might pick up another fare.' Since his luck was strangely good today, who could guarantee that such good fortune wouldn't happen again? He gained a certainty that was strong enough to bet on, that good luck, chasing its tail, was definitely waiting for him. However, he couldn't stand in front of the station because of the aggressive rickshaw pullers there. So, as he had done many times before, he parked his rickshaw a little away from the tram stop in front of the station, in the space between the pedestrian path and the tram tracks, and he himself circled nearby, observing the situation. After a while, a train arrived, and dozens of passengers spilled out onto the platform. Among them, Kim Cheomji's eyes spotted a woman who seemed to be a retired *gisaeng* or a rebellious female student, with Western-style hair, high-heeled shoes, and even a cape. He slowly approached her.

"Madam, would you like a rickshaw?"

The woman, whether a student or not, kept her lips tightly sealed for a long time, putting on airs, and didn't even glance at Kim Cheomji. Kim Cheomji, like a begging beggar or something, constantly scrutinized her expression,

"Madam, I'll take you for much cheaper than the boys at the station. Where do you live?"

And he presumptuously laid his hand on the Japanese-style wicker basket she was carrying.

"What are you doing? Don't bother me."

She shouted like thunder and turned away. Kim Cheomji backed off, startled.

The tram arrived. Kim Cheomji glared resentfully at those getting on the tram. However, his premonition was not wrong. Just as the tram, packed with people, began to move, there was one passenger left. Judging by the extraordinarily large bag he was carrying, he probably had been pushed off the crowded tram by the conductor because his luggage was too big. Kim Cheomji stepped forward.

"Would you like a rickshaw?"

After haggling over the price for a while, he agreed to take him to Insadong for sixty jeon. When the rickshaw became heavy, his body strangely became light, and when the rickshaw became light again, his body again became heavy, but this time his mind too became anxious. The scene at his house kept flickering before his eyes, and he no longer had the leisure to hope for good fortune. He had no choice but to scold his legs, which felt like tree stumps, not his own, and run frantically. Passersby might worry, "How can that rickshaw puller, so drunk, go on this muddy road?" His steps were that hurried. The cloudy, rainy sky already seemed close to dusk. It was only when he reached Changgyeongwon front that he finally caught his breath and slowed his pace. As he got closer to his house, step by step, his mind strangely softened. But this softening did not come from relief; it came from the fear that the moment he would inevitably realize the terrible misfortune that had befallen him was approaching. He struggled to prolong the time before facing misfortune, even if just for a little while. He wanted to hold onto the joy of earning a near-miraculous amount for as long as possible. He looked around nervously. His demeanor was as if he were pleading, "Someone stop me, save me," because he couldn't control his own legs, which were running towards his house—towards misfortune.

Just then, his friend Chi-sam came out of a roadside tavern. His plump, fleshy face seemed to be covered in vermilion, with a thick, black beard covering his entire chin and cheeks, creating a strange contrast to Kim Cheomji's appearance—his sallow, emaciated face with furrows here and there, and only a beard under his chin, like an inverted pine needle cluster.

"Hey, Kim Cheomji, you seem to be coming from inside the gate. You must have earned a lot of money, let's have a drink quickly."

The plump man shouted as soon as he saw the skinny one. His voice, unlike his physique, was soft and genial. Kim Cheomji couldn't express how glad he was to meet this friend. He felt grateful, as if he had met a savior.

"You've already had a drink, it seems. You look like you're having a good time today too."

Kim Cheomji smiled, his face brightening.

"Aish, can't I drink even if I'm not having a good time? But hey, you look like a drowned rat. Come in here and dry off."

The tavern was warm and cozy. Each time the lid of the *chueotang* (loach soup) pot was opened, white steam billowed out. Grilled *neobiani* (thinly sliced seasoned beef), pork, liver, kidneys, dried pollock, and *bindaetteok* (mung bean pancakes) sizzled on the grill... Kim Cheomji suddenly felt an unbearable heartburn at the sight of the messy spread of appetizers on the table. If he had his way, he would have devoured every single dish there, but being hungry, he first ordered two large *bindaetteok* and a bowl of *chueotang*. His empty stomach tasted the food and became even emptier, urging him to eat more and more. In an instant, he drank a bowl of soup with tofu and loach, as if it were water. When he received the third bowl, two large glasses of warmed *makgeolli* arrived. As he drank with Chi-sam, the alcohol spread through his empty stomach with a tingling sensation, and his face flushed. He drank another large glass.

Kim Cheomji's eyes had already begun to unfocus. He roughly sliced two pieces of *tteok* (rice cakes) from the grill, puffed out his cheeks, and asked for two more large glasses.

Chi-sam looked at Kim Cheomji, bewildered, and warned,

"Hey, more? We've already had four glasses each. That's forty jeon."

"Aish, you fool, is forty jeon such a big deal? I earned a lot of money today. Truly, today was a lucky day."

"So, how much did you earn?"

"I earned thirty won! Thirty won! Why aren't you pouring this damned liquor... It's fine, it's fine, it doesn't matter if I drink a lot. I earned a mountain of money today."

"Oh, this man is drunk. Let's stop."

"You fool, am I the kind to get drunk on this? Drink more!"

The drunk man shouted, grabbing Chi-sam's ear. And he lunged at the fifteen-year-old bald-headed boy who was pouring the liquor,

"You damned rascal! Why aren't you pouring the liquor!"

The bald-headed boy smiled broadly and winked at Chi-sam, as if asking for guidance. The drunkard noticed this and burst into anger,

"You damned rascals, you think I don't have money!"

No sooner had he said this than he fumbled at his waist and pulled out a one-won bill, flinging it onto the table in front of the bald-headed boy. A few silver coins clinked and fell in the rush.

"Hey, your money fell. Why are you throwing money around?"

Saying this, he began picking up the money. Kim Cheomji, even in his drunken state, seemed to be checking the whereabouts of his money, opening his eyes wide and looking down at the ground. Then, as if his actions were too dirty, he jerked his head and became even angrier,

"Look! Look! You dirty rascals, do you think I have no money? You're like those who'd break my leg bones!"

He took the money Chi-sam had picked up and,

"This cursed money! This despicable money!"

He threw it around wildly. The money, hitting the wall, fell back into the pot where the liquor was simmering, clanging as if it were receiving its rightful beating.

Two large glasses were drunk again without even time to be poured. Kim Cheomji sucked the liquor from his lips and beard, then, stroking his pine needle-like beard with great satisfaction,

"Pour more, pour more!"

He shouted.

After another drink, Kim Cheomji slapped Chi-sam's shoulder and suddenly burst out laughing. His laughter was so loud that everyone in the tavern turned their eyes to him. The laughing man laughed even more,

"Hey, Chi-sam, shall I tell you a funny story? Today, I took a passenger to the station, didn't I?"

"So?"

"It seemed a shame to come back empty-handed. So, I was lingering at the tram stop, trying to figure out how to pick up a passenger. Just then, there was a madam or a female student (these days, how can you tell the difference between a prostitute and a lady?) standing in the rain, wearing a cape. I slowly approached her and asked, 'Would you like a rickshaw?' and tried to take her handbag, but she slapped my hand away and spun around, saying, 'Why are you bothering me like this!' That voice was truly like a nightingale's, ha ha!"

Kim Cheomji skillfully imitated a truly nightingale-like voice. Everyone laughed at once.

"That damned stingy woman, who's bothering her? 'Why are you bothering me!' Oh my, such a shameless voice, ha ha."

The laughter grew louder. But before the laughter completely faded, Kim Cheomji began to sob.

Chi-sam stared at the drunkard in bewilderment,

"You were just laughing like crazy, now what's with the crying?"

Kim Cheomji kept sniffing,

"My wife died."

"What? Your wife died? When?"

"You fool, when? Today, of course."

"Oh, you crazy bastard, don't lie."

"Why would I lie? She really died, really... I left my wife's corpse at home and I'm drinking liquor, I'm a killer, a killer."

And Kim Cheomji wailed loudly.

Chi-sam's expression became a little sober,

"Oh, this person, is he telling the truth or lying? Then let's go home, go."

And he pulled the weeping man's arm.

Shaking off Chi-sam's pulling hand, Kim Cheomji smiled, his eyes glistening with tears.

"Who died?"

He said, triumphant.

"Why would she die? She's alive and well. That damned woman is just pretending. Now I've tricked you."

And he clapped his hands like a child, laughing.

"Is this man really crazy? I did hear that your wife was sick."

Chi-sam, feeling some unease, also urged Kim Cheomji to go back home.

"She didn't die, I told you she didn't die!"

Kim Cheomji shouted angrily and confidently, but there was a tone in his voice that struggled to believe she wasn't dead. He finally filled up a won's worth, drank one more large glass, and came out. The dreary rain continued to fall steadily.

Even in his drunkenness, Kim Cheomji bought *seolleongtang* and arrived home. His home, of course, was a rented room, and not even the entire house, but a single *haengnangbang* (a room in the outer building) completely separate from the main house, for which he paid one won a month and drew water. If Kim Cheomji hadn't been drunk, as soon as he stepped through the gate, the terrifying silence that pervaded the place—a silence like the sea after a storm—would have made his legs tremble. He couldn't hear his wife's coughing. He couldn't even hear her rattling breaths. Only the faint sucking sound, *ppak-ppak*, of a baby nursing, which broke this tomb-like silence—or rather, deepened and made it more ominous. If one's hearing was keen, one might even guess that the *ppak-ppak* sound was only sucking, and there was no *kkul-tteok-kkul-tteok* sound of milk going down, meaning the baby was sucking on an empty breast.

Perhaps Kim Cheomji also sensed this ominous silence. Otherwise, it was suspicious that as soon as he entered the gate, he, unlike before, shouted,

"You damned woman! Your husband's home, and you don't even come out, you damned woman!"

This shout was nothing but bravado to drive away the terrifying premonition that was assailing him.

Anyway, Kim Cheomji flung open the door. A sickening stench—the smell of dust from under the broken straw mat, the smell of feces and urine from unwashed diapers, the smell of clothes layered with various kinds of grime, and the rotten smell of the sick person's sweat—assailed Kim Cheomji's dulled nose.

Stepping into the room, without even time to put the *seolleongtang* in a corner, the drunkard bellowed at the top of his lungs.

"You damned woman, is it best to just lie around all day and night? Your husband's home, and you can't even get up!"

And with that, he kicked the lying person's leg hard. But what his foot kicked felt not like human flesh but like a tree stump. At this moment, the *ppak-ppak* sound turned into a "eung-a" sound. Gaettongi let go of the breast he had been sucking and cried. Even his crying was merely a grimace across his entire face, and the "eung-a" sound seemed to come not from his mouth but from deep inside his belly. He seemed to have cried until his throat was hoarse and he had no more energy to cry.

Seeing that kicking had no effect, the husband rushed to his wife's head, grabbed her bird's nest-like hair, and shook her,

"You bitch, speak! Speak! Is your mouth glued shut, you damned woman!"

"..."

"Uh-huh, look, no answer."

"..."

"You bitch, are you dead? Why don't you say anything?"

"..."

"Uh-huh, still no answer. She's really dead, it seems."

Then, as soon as he recognized the wide-open eyes staring upwards above the white cloth covering the lying person,

"These eyes! These eyes! Why aren't you looking at me and only at the ceiling, huh?"

His voice choked at the end of his words. Then, tears like chicken droppings fell from the living man's eyes, splattering the dead woman's stiff face. Suddenly, Kim Cheomji frantically rubbed his face against the dead woman's face and mumbled,

"I bought *seolleongtang*, why can't you eat it? Why can't you eat it... Strangely, today! My luck was, good..."

**The So-Called Lucky Day**

Hyun Jin-geon

It was a day with a deceptively overcast sky, hinting at snow, but instead, half-frozen rain fell steadily and mournfully.

This day, for Kim Cheomji, a rickshaw puller struggling within Dongsomun Gate, was indeed a stroke of luck he hadn't encountered in ages, a day he had desperately yearned for. Starting with escorting the lady from the house across the street—who insisted on entering the gate, though it wasn't outside—to the tram line, he then sent glances that verged on outright pleading to every person alighting at the station, desperate for a fare. Finally, he secured a passenger, a man in a suit who seemed to be a teacher, to Donggwang School.

Thirty *jeon* for the first ride, fifty *jeon* for the second—it wasn't a bad start right off the bat in the morning. Kim Cheomji, who had been cursed with such persistent bad luck that he hadn't seen a coin for nearly ten days, was so overjoyed that he almost wept when three or five ten-jeon copper coins clinked into his palm. Moreover, he knew how truly valuable these eighty *jeon* were to him at that moment. He could wet his parched throat with a cup of rice wine, but more importantly, he could buy a bowl of *seolleongtang* for his ailing wife.

His wife had been coughing persistently for over a month now. She had already missed several meals...

"Hey, don't just lie there\! You're gonna die at home, you damned bitch\!" Kim Cheomji, who had just returned, grumbled to his wife.

His wife, her face pale and her eyes wide and staring, turned her head slightly towards the wall and, with a choked, wheezing voice, mumbled, "I... I really think I'm going to die. I'm so dizzy, and my head aches so badly."

"What? You say you're gonna die, you damned rascal? Don't even think about dying\!" Kim Cheomji, usually gentle with his wife, unexpectedly slapped her on the cheek.

"Just die, go on and die\! What good are you alive, you damned bitch\!"

Her wide, staring eyes straightened slightly, though tears welled. Kim Cheomji's own eyes stung with a burning heat, on the verge of tears. He had no choice but to go out. Although he was now eighty *jeon* richer, a fresh worry pressed down on his chest. Yet, a gnawing guilt lingered within him for not being able to buy it for her.

"Damn it\! How could I possibly buy *seolleongtang* for a dying woman? What good is it to buy it if she's going to die anyway? I'll buy it after I make some more money, when I return," he mumbled to himself, trying to make excuses as he rushed out the door. He was running not so much as flying, desperate to put distance between himself and his home, wanting to stretch out the time before disaster struck. He was simply trying to escape the ominous feeling, to avoid the bad omen he felt within his chest.

Afterward, he took three more fares. The first was a female student who went to Jeongdong, the next was a gentleman who went to Insa-dong, and the last was a child who went to the Bank of Joseon. As the money accumulated in his wallet, his heart felt increasingly full. Yet, the pulling became heavier, and the puller's legs grew heavier. With each step, the rain grew thicker and his clothes became soaked.

The sun had long set, and the streetlights had already flickered on. When he reached the place where the road splits near the Japanese market, he saw a rickshaw that looked like a 'brother.' He felt like talking to someone, so he said, "How's business?"

"Damn, why's the rain coming down like this? And on top of that, there's no business at all."

"You're right. I haven't even made thirty *jeon* today. It's really the pits."

"Hmph\! You're really talking nonsense\! I've made over a *won* today. But why is this rain...?"

He suddenly stopped talking. He had meant to boast, but the thought of his sick wife made his throat clench. He rushed back home.

"Did you take the *seolleongtang* to the house?" Kim Cheomji asked the shop assistant as he pulled his rickshaw past the *seolleongtang* shop.

"No, I didn't," the shop assistant replied.

He returned home and opened the door. The room was chillingly silent, as if it were a tomb. Only the faint, desolate *ppak-ppak*—a sound that didn't merely break this tomb-like silence but rather deepened its chilling stillness, making it even more ominous—the sound of a baby nursing on an empty breast.

"Hey, why are you lying there without a sound, huh? Why aren't you getting up, you damned woman? Your husband's home, and you can't even get up\!"

And with that, he kicked the lying person's leg hard. But what his foot kicked felt not like human flesh but like a tree stump. At this moment, the *ppak-ppak* sound turned into a "eung-a" sound. Gaettongi let go of the breast he had been sucking and cried. Even his crying was merely a grimace across his entire face, and the "eung-a" sound seemed to come not from his mouth but from deep inside his belly. He seemed to have cried until his throat was hoarse and he had no more energy to cry.

Seeing that kicking had no effect, the husband rushed to his wife's head, grabbed her bird's nest-like hair, and shook her,

"You bitch, speak\! Speak\! Is your mouth glued shut, you damned woman\!"

"...\<br\>
"Uh-huh, look, no answer."

"..."

"You bitch, are you dead? Why don't you say anything?"

"..."

"Uh-huh, still no answer. She's really dead, it seems."

Then, as soon as he recognized the wide-open eyes staring upwards above the white cloth covering the lying person,

"These eyes\! These eyes\! Why aren't you looking at me and only at the ceiling, huh?"

His voice choked at the end of his words. Then, tears like chicken droppings fell from the living man's eyes, splattering the dead woman's stiff face. Suddenly, Kim Cheomji frantically rubbed his face...

"Damn, why's the rain coming down like this? And on top of that, there's no business at all."

"You're right. I haven't even made thirty *jeon* today. It's really the pits."

"Hmph\! You're really talking nonsense\! I've made over a *won* today. But why is this rain...?"

He suddenly stopped talking. He had meant to boast, but the thought of his sick wife made his throat clench. He rushed back home.

"Did you take the *seolleongtang* to the house?" Kim Cheomji asked the shop assistant as he pulled his rickshaw past the *seolleongtang* shop.

"No, I didn't," the shop assistant replied.

He returned home and opened the door. The room was chillingly silent, as if it were a tomb. Only the faint, desolate *ppak-ppak*—a sound that didn't merely break this tomb-like silence but rather deepened its chilling stillness, making it even more ominous—the sound of a baby nursing on an empty breast.

"Hey, why are you lying there without a sound, huh? Why aren't you getting up, you damned woman? Your husband's home, and you can't even get up\!"

And with that, he kicked the lying person's leg hard. But what his foot kicked felt not like human flesh but like a tree stump. At this moment, the *ppak-ppak* sound turned into a "eung-a" sound. Gaettongi let go of the breast he had been sucking and cried. Even his crying was merely a grimace across his entire face, and the "eung-a" sound seemed to come not from his mouth but from deep inside his belly. He seemed to have cried until his throat was hoarse and he had no more energy to cry.

Seeing that kicking had no effect, the husband rushed to his wife's head, grabbed her bird's nest-like hair, and shook her,

"You bitch, speak\! Speak\! Is your mouth glued shut, you damned woman\!"

"...\<br\>
"Uh-huh, look, no answer."

"..."

"You bitch, are you dead? Why don't you say anything?"

"..."

"Uh-huh, still no answer. She's really dead, it seems."

Then, as soon as he recognized the wide-open eyes staring upwards above the white cloth covering the lying person,

"These eyes\! These eyes\! Why aren't you looking at me and only at the ceiling, huh?"

His voice choked at the end of his words. Then, tears like chicken droppings fell from the living man's eyes, splattering the dead woman's stiff face. Suddenly, Kim Cheomji frantically rubbed his face...
He sobbed, and his voice began to crack.

"Wife\! Wife\! Why did you die, you damned woman\! My wife, why did you die? Don't you know how much I earned today? Don't you know that I brought *seolleongtang*? Hey, hey\! Wake up and eat this\! Why don't you eat it? It's so cold\! Why do you keep lying there? You're not dead, are you? Aren't you? Tell me\!"

He cried, his head resting on her shoulders, as if he would never let go. The *seolleongtang* was cold. The soup, which had been warm, was now cold.

**A Lucky Day**

**Hyun Jin-geon**

The sky was oppressively overcast, threatening snow, but instead, an icy rain drizzled down.

For Kim Cheomji, a rickshaw puller who worked within Dongsomun Gate, this was, in fact, a stroke of good fortune, a rare lucky day after a long dry spell. His morning began with delivering a lady from the house next door, who fancied herself too grand to walk outside the gate, to the tram station. From there, hoping for another fare, he loitered at the station, his gaze, almost pleading, fixed on each person who disembarked. At last, a gentleman in a suit, seemingly a teacher, agreed to be taken to Donggwang School.

Thirty *jeon* for the first trip, fifty *jeon* for the second – not a bad start for the early morning. Kim Cheomji, whose luck had truly been cursed for almost ten days, hadn't seen a single coin. When those three or five clinking ten-*jeon* copper coins dropped into his palm, he was so overjoyed he could almost weep. Moreover, at this very moment, these eighty *jeon* were incredibly useful to him. They could moisten his parched throat with a glass of *moju* (rice wine), but more importantly, they could buy a bowl of *seolleongtang* (ox bone soup) for his ailing wife.

His wife had been coughing for over a month. Given their situation, barely managing to eat millet gruel, she had, of course, never taken a single dose of medicine. Not that they absolutely couldn't afford it, but he remained utterly faithful to his belief that if you gave medicine to illness, it would grow fond of you and keep coming back. Since he had never taken her to a doctor, he didn't know what her illness was. However, seeing her lying flat on her back, unable to even turn on her side, indicated it was indeed severe. The illness had worsened to this extent because she had suffered indigestion from eating millet gruel ten days ago. At that time, Kim Cheomji, having earned some money after a long while, had bought a liter of millet and a ten-*jeon* bundle of firewood. According to Kim Cheomji, that wretched woman, in her wild haste, boiled it in a pot. Her mind was impatient, and the fire wouldn’t catch, so it wasn't even properly cooked. That wretched woman, instead of using a spoon, grabbed handfuls with her bare hands, stuffing it down as if someone would snatch it away, until her cheeks bulged like fists. From that evening on, she started complaining of chest pains and stomach cramps, rolling her eyes like she was having a fit. At that moment, Kim Cheomji, furious, yelled,

"Damn it, you cursed woman! You can’t win with millet gruel. Sick from not eating, sick from eating! What do you want me to do?! Why can't you open your eyes properly!"

And he slapped the ailing woman's cheek once. Her widely opened eyes straightened a little, but tears welled up. Kim Cheomji's own eyes felt hot.

Even in this state, the patient didn't lose her appetite. For three days now, she had been nagging her husband for *seolleongtang* broth.

"You damned woman! You can't even eat millet gruel, and you want *seolleongtang*? So you can eat it and get another fit?"

He scolded her, but his heart felt uneasy because he couldn't buy it for her.

Now, he could buy *seolleongtang*. He could even buy gruel for Gaettongi, their three-year-old, who was hungry and whimpering by his ailing mother's side. With eighty *jeon* in his hand, Kim Cheomji’s heart felt generous.

But his good fortune didn't end there. He was wiping his neck, where sweat and rainwater mingled, with his perpetually greasy towel, when he turned out of the school gate. From behind, a voice called, "Rickshaw!" Kim Cheomji knew with one look that the person who had called him was a student from that school. The student abruptly asked,

"How much to Namdaemun Station?"

Perhaps he was a resident of the school dormitory, planning to return home for the winter break. He had decided to leave today, but the rain, coupled with his luggage, left him at a loss until he saw Kim Cheomji and rushed out. Otherwise, why would he be dragging his feet, unable to properly wear his shoes, and chasing after Kim Cheomji in the rain, despite wearing a fine Gogura suit?

"To Namdaemun Station, you say?"

Kim Cheomji hesitated for a moment. Was it because he didn't want to trudge through the muddy distance in this pouring rain without rain gear? Or was he simply satisfied with his first two fares? No, definitely not. He was strangely afraid of this good fortune, which seemed to cling to him relentlessly. And his wife's plea when he left home weighed heavily on his mind — when the lady from the house next door came to call him, his wife, with her bony face and uniquely large, sunken eyes, like the only spring water on her face, had looked at him with an imploring gaze, murmuring like a mosquito, her breath rattling:

"Please don't go out today. Please, for my sake, just stay home. I'm so sick…"

At that moment, Kim Cheomji had acted as if it were nothing, saying,

"Oh, damn you, you cursed woman! You talk such nonsense. Who do you think will feed us if I just sit here with you?"

And as he leaped out, the patient waved her arm as if to grab him,

"I told you not to go out! If you must, then come home early!"

Her choked voice followed him.

The moment he heard the request to go to the station, his wife’s face, her trembling hands, and her unusually large, tearful eyes, flickered before Kim Cheomji's eyes.

"So, how much to Namdaemun Station?" the student asked impatiently, looking at the rickshaw puller's face, muttering to himself, "The Incheon train is at eleven, and then the next one is at two, I think?"

"One *won* fifty *jeon*, please,"

The words burst out of Kim Cheomji's mouth before he realized it. He was startled by the outrageous sum he had named himself. How long had it been since he had dared to ask for such a large amount at once! Yet, the courage to earn that money extinguished his worry for his ailing wife. What could possibly happen to her by today, he thought. No matter what, he couldn't miss this luck, which was more than double the combined sum of his first and second fares.

"One *won* fifty *jeon* is too much," the student said, tilting his head.

"Not at all. By distance, it's over fifteen *ri* from here. And on a rainy day like this, you should pay a little more."

A barely concealed joy overflowed on the rickshaw puller's smiling face.

"Alright, I'll pay what you ask, just hurry."

The generous young customer left those words and rushed off to get dressed and pack his luggage.

As Kim Cheomji set off with the student, his legs felt strangely light. Rather than running, he seemed to be almost flying. The wheels spun so quickly they seemed to glide like skates on ice rather than roll, although the frozen, rain-slicked ground made it truly slippery.

Eventually, the puller's legs grew heavy. It was because he was nearing his own home. A renewed worry pressed down on his chest. "Please don't go out today, I'm so sick…" These words echoed in his ears. And his wife's sunken eyes seemed to glare at him accusingly. Then, he seemed to hear Gaettongi's wailing cry. He seemed to hear the gasping, hiccupping breaths as well.

"Why are you dawdling? You'll miss the train!"

The passenger's impatient shout barely reached his ears. Suddenly, Kim Cheomji realized he was standing stock-still in the middle of the road, holding his rickshaw.

"Yes, yes."

And Kim Cheomji started running again. As his house grew further away, his steps regained their vigor. He seemed to move his legs quickly only to forget all the worries and anxieties that incessantly plagued his mind.

After delivering the passenger to the station and actually holding the astonishing one *won* fifty *jeon* in his hand, he felt grateful as if he had gotten it for free, not thinking about the ten-*ri* journey he had slogged through in the rain. He was as delighted as a sudden millionaire. He bowed several times to the young customer, who was barely old enough to be his son, and politely bade him farewell,

"Have a safe trip."

However, the thought of rattling back through the rain with an empty rickshaw was unexpected. As the sweat from his labor cooled, a creeping chill rose from his hungry gut and his drenched clothes. He felt deeply, viscerally, just how valuable and painful one *won* fifty *jeon* was. His steps leaving the station lacked any strength. His whole body hunched, as if he might collapse right there and never get up.

"Damn it! To go back with an empty rickshaw in this rain! Why does this cursed rain hit my face so hard?!"

He raged furiously, snarling as if defying someone. Just then, a new light dawned in his mind: "Instead of just going back, if I circle around here and wait for a train, I might pick up another passenger." Who could guarantee that such good fortune, so unusually abundant today, wouldn't happen again? He gained a certainty strong enough to bet on, a belief that good luck, indeed, was waiting for him. Still, he couldn't stand directly in front of the station, fearing the pushiness of the station rickshaw pullers. So, as he had done many times before, he parked his rickshaw a little away from the tram stop in front of the station, in the space between the pedestrian path and the tram tracks, and then lingered nearby, observing the situation. After a while, a train arrived, and dozens of passengers poured into the station. Among them, Kim Cheomji's eyes caught sight of a woman who looked like a faded *gisaeng* or a rebellious schoolgirl, with permed hair, high-heeled shoes, and even a cape. He stealthily approached her.

"Madam, wouldn't you like a rickshaw?"

The woman, whether a student or not, maintained a disdainful expression for a long time, her lips pressed tightly, not even glancing at Kim Cheomji. Kim Cheomji, like a begging pauper, continuously scrutinized her expression, asking,

"Madam, I'll take you for much cheaper than the station boys. Where is your home?"

And presumptuously, he touched the Japanese-style wicker basket she was carrying.

"What do you want? Don't bother me!"

She yelled like thunder and turned away. Kim Cheomji flinched back, startled.

The tram arrived. Kim Cheomji glared resentfully at those boarding the tram. But his premonition was not wrong. As the tram, packed with people, began to move, one passenger remained. Seeing the enormous bag he carried, he seemed to have been pushed off by the conductor because his luggage was too bulky for the crowded car. Kim Cheomji stepped forward.

"Would you like a rickshaw?"

After haggling over the price for a while, he agreed to take him to Insadong for sixty *jeon*. As the rickshaw became heavy, his body strangely grew lighter, and then, as the rickshaw became lighter, his body grew heavy again, but this time, even his heart felt anxious. The scene at his house kept flickering before his eyes, leaving him no leisure to hope for more luck. He could only scold his legs, which felt like tree stumps, not his own, and ran frantically, his steps so hurried that passersby might worry, "How can that rickshaw puller, so drunk, go on in this muddy ground?" The overcast, rainy sky already seemed to near the dim twilight. Only when he reached in front of Changgyeong Palace did he catch his breath and slow his pace. As he neared his house, step by step, his heart felt strangely softened. But this softening did not come from relief; it came from the dread that the moment he would undeniably discover the terrible misfortune that had befallen him was drawing near. He struggled to prolong the time before misfortune struck, if only for a little while. He wanted to hold onto the joy of earning a near-miraculous amount for as long as possible. He looked around him, peering. His posture was as if he were saying, "Someone, please grab me, save me, for I cannot control these legs of mine that are running towards my home—towards misfortune."

Just then, his friend Chi-sam emerged from a roadside tavern. His fat, round face, flushed crimson as if painted with vermillion, with thick, dark whiskers covering his entire jaw and cheeks, presented a peculiar contrast to Kim Cheomji's gaunt, sallow face, furrowed with wrinkles, whose only beard was a small, pine-needle-like tuft beneath his chin, inverted.

"Hey, Kim Cheomji, looks like you're back from inside the gate. You must have earned a lot of money, let's have a drink quickly!"

The stout man shouted as soon as he saw the skinny one. His voice, contrary to his build, was soft and friendly. Kim Cheomji couldn't express how glad he was to see his friend. He felt as grateful as if Chi-sam were his savior.

"Looks like you've already had a drink yourself. You seem to be having a good day today too." Kim Cheomji said, his face breaking into a smile.

"Oh, come on, can't a man drink if he's not having a good day? But hey, Kim Cheomji, why does your whole body look like a drenched mouse that fell into a water jar? Come in here and dry off."

The tavern was warm and cozy. Each time the lid of the *chueotang* (loach soup) pot was opened, white steam billowed out. On the messy table laden with appetizers—broiled beef slices, pork, liver, kidneys, dried pollack, and mung bean pancakes sizzling on the grill—Kim Cheomji suddenly felt an unbearable pang in his stomach. If he could have his way, he would have devoured every single dish there, but as a hungry man, he first ordered two large mung bean pancakes and a bowl of *chueotang*. His empty stomach tasted the food and became even emptier, repeatedly urging him to drink more, eat more. In an instant, he gulped down a bowl of soup with tofu and loach, as if it were just water. When he received his third bowl, two heated double-shots of *makgeolli* (rice wine) were served. As he drank with Chi-sam, the liquor spread through his utterly empty stomach with a tingling sensation, making his face flush. He pressed for another double-shot.

Kim Cheomji's eyes were already beginning to blur. He sliced two rice cakes from the grill, chewed them with bulging cheeks, and demanded two more double-shots.

Chi-sam looked at Kim Cheomji with a puzzled expression.

"Hey, another pour? We've already had four shots each, that's forty *jeon*."

"Oh, you fool, is forty *jeon* so much? I earned a ton of money today. Yes, today was truly a lucky day."

"So, how much did you earn?"

"I earned thirty *won*, thirty *won*! Why aren't you pouring this damned liquor... It's fine, it's fine. It doesn't matter how much I drink. I earned a mountain of money today."

"Uh, this man is drunk. Let's stop."

"You fool, am I the kind of person to get drunk from this? Drink more!"

And grabbing Chi-sam's ear, the drunkard shouted. Then, he rushed towards the young server, who looked about fifteen with a shaved head, yelling,

"You bastard, you cursed brat! Why aren't you pouring the liquor?!"

The server chuckled, winking at Chi-sam as if asking for guidance. The drunkard, noticing this, flared up in anger,

"Damn these cursed bastards! Do you think I have no money?!"

As soon as he said that, he fumbled at his waist, pulled out a one-*won* bill, and flung it onto the table in front of the server. In the commotion, a few silver coins clinked and fell.

"Hey, your money fell. Why are you throwing money around?"

He said this while picking up the coins. Even in his drunkenness, Kim Cheomji seemed to keep an eye on his money, opening his eyes wide and looking down at the floor. Then, as if suddenly disgusted by his own actions, he jerked his head back and became even angrier,

"Look! Look, you filthy bastards! Do you think I don't have money? You'll have your leg bones broken!"

And taking the money Chi-sam picked up for him, he yelled,

"This cursed money! This damned money!"

And he slapped it against the wall. The money, hitting the wall, fell into the pot where liquor was being warmed, ringing out as if receiving a rightful beating.

Two more double-shots were poured and swallowed before they could even cool. Kim Cheomji sucked the liquor from his lips and beard, then, seemingly very satisfied, stroked his pine-needle-like beard, shouting,

"Pour more! Pour more!"

After another drink, Kim Cheomji slapped Chi-sam's shoulder and suddenly burst into boisterous laughter. His laughter was so loud that everyone in the tavern turned their eyes to him. The laughing man laughed even more,

"Hey, Chi-sam, want to hear a funny story? Today, I took a passenger to the station, you know?"

"And?"

"It felt wrong to just come back empty-handed. So, I was loitering at the tram stop, trying to find another passenger. And there, standing in the rain, was some lady or a schoolgirl (these days, how can you even tell a *nondani* from a young lady?) wearing a cape. I subtly approached her and asked if she wanted a rickshaw, and as I tried to take her hand luggage, she slapped my hand away and spun around, saying, 'Why are you bothering me like this!' That voice, oh, it was like a nightingale's, ha ha!"

Kim Cheomji skillfully mimicked a truly nightingale-like voice. Everyone in the tavern burst into laughter.

"That damned stingy woman, who was even doing anything to her? 'Why are you bothering me like this!' Ugh, such an ill-mannered voice, ha ha."

The laughter grew louder. But before the laughter had completely died down, Kim Cheomji suddenly began to sob.

Chi-sam, dumbfounded, stared at the drunkard.

"Just now you were laughing like crazy, now why are you crying?"

Kim Cheomji continuously sniffled.

"My wife… she died."

"What? Your wife died? When?"

"When, you fool? Today."

"Get out, you crazy man, don't lie."

"Why would I lie? She really died, really… I left my wife's corpse at home and I'm drinking alcohol? I'm a murderer, a murderer!"

Kim Cheomji wailed loudly.

Chi-sam, his enthusiasm somewhat dampened, said,

"Oh, this man, is he telling the truth or lying? Well, let's go home, let's go."

And he pulled the weeping man's arm.

Kim Cheomji shook off Chi-sam's hand, then with tear-filled eyes, he smiled faintly.

"Who died?" he asked, triumphantly.

"Why would she die? She's alive and well. That damned woman was just playing sick. I tricked you now!"

And like a child, he clapped his hands and laughed.

"Is this man really crazy? I did hear that your wife was ill."

Chi-sam also felt a certain unease and urged Kim Cheomji to go home again.

"She's not dead! I said she's not dead!"

Kim Cheomji shouted angrily and with conviction, but there was a tone in his voice that tried hard to believe she wasn't dead. He insisted on finishing a whole *won*'s worth, and after another double-shot each, they left. The dreary rain continued to drizzle down.

Even in his drunkenness, Kim Cheomji arrived home with the *seolleongtang*. His home, of course, was a rented room, not the entire house, but a single *haengrangbang* (outbuilding room) separate from the main house, for which he paid one *won* a month for water. If Kim Cheomji hadn't been inebriated, his legs would surely have trembled the moment he stepped inside the gate, faced with the terrifying silence that dominated the place — a silence like the sea after a storm. He couldn't hear his wife's coughing. He couldn't even hear her rattling breath. Only the gentle *pak-pak* sound, breaking this tomb-like silence – or rather, deepening it and making it more ominous – the sound of a baby sucking. If someone's hearing were keen, they might realize that the *pak-pak* sound was just sucking, and there was no gulping sound, meaning the baby was sucking an empty breast.

Perhaps Kim Cheomji also sensed this ominous silence. Otherwise, it was suspicious that he shouted as soon as he entered the gate, louder than usual,

"You damned bitch! Your husband's home, and you don't even come out, you cursed woman!"

For this shout was merely an empty bravado, meant to drive away the terrifying premonition that was overwhelming him.

Anyway, Kim Cheomji flung open the door. A nauseating stench — the smell of dust from under the torn straw mat, the stench of feces and urine from unwashed diapers, the accumulated grime from layers of clothing, and the putrid smell of the sick woman's sweat — assailed Kim Cheomji's dulled nose.

Stepping into the room, before he even had a chance to put the *seolleongtang* in a corner, the drunkard bellowed at the top of his lungs,

"You cursed woman! Lying there all day and night, that's all you're good for! Your husband comes home and you can't even get up!"

Along with these words, he violently kicked the lying figure's leg. However, what his foot struck felt not like human flesh but like a tree stump. At this moment, the baby's *pak-pak* sound turned into a wail. Gaettongi let go of the breast she had been sucking and cried. Even as she cried, her whole face was contorted into a grimace that merely expressed crying. The wail didn't seem to come from her mouth but rather from deep within her stomach. She cried and cried until her voice was hoarse, as if she had no more strength to cry.

Seeing that kicking had no effect, the husband rushed to his wife's bedside and indeed, grabbed the patient's bird's nest-like hair, shaking it,

"Woman, speak! Speak! Is your mouth stuck, you cursed woman?!"

"..."

"Huh, look, no answer."

"..."

"Woman, are you dead? Why aren't you speaking?"

"..."

"Huh, still no answer. She's really dead, it seems."

Then, as soon as he saw her eyes, fixed upwards, staring through the white sheet covering the lying figure,

"These eyes! These eyes! Why aren't you looking at me, but only at the ceiling, huh?!"

His voice caught at the end of the sentence. Then, tears like chicken droppings fell from the living man's eyes, splattering the dead woman's stiff face. Suddenly, Kim Cheomji frantically rubbed his face against the dead woman's face, murmuring,

"I bought you *seolleongtang*, why can't you eat it, why can't you eat it... How strange it is today! Such good fortune, and yet..."
