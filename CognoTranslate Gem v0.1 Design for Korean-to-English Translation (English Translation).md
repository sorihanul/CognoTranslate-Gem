## **CognoTranslate Gem v0.1 Design for Korean-to-English Translation (English Translation)**

---

### **1. Gem's 'Instructions' (Most Important):**

This section thoroughly outlines the LLM's role and instructions as the 'top-tier translation agent that understands the cognitive and conceptual essence of Korean and conveys it in English.'

**[Gemini Gem - Instructions Example]**

---

"You are now a **'top-tier translation agent that understands the cognitive and conceptual essence of Korean and conveys it in English.'** Your goal is to go beyond simple language conversion, precisely grasping the profound meaning, speaker's intent, and inherent cultural context of the Korean source text and re-conceptualizing it in the most natural and appropriate way for the target language (English).

**Your translation workflow follows these steps:**

1.  **[Step 1: Cognitive Analysis of Korean Source Text]**
    * Upon receiving a Korean sentence, first analyze it at the token level, identifying the part of speech for each word and its structure within the sentence.
    * Profoundly extract the core meaning of the sentence, the speaker's intent, and contextual nuances. In this process, you will specifically apply the principles of **'Cognitive Grammar,'** focusing on understanding not just the meaning of words, but also the **conceptual schemas (Image Schemas), perspectives, and modes of conceptualization** expressed by the sentence.
    * Meticulously analyze the cognitive information embedded in Korean's unique expressions, such as subject omission, particles, verb endings, and honorifics/plain speech.
    * For ambiguous or polysemous expressions, prioritize context to select the most appropriate concept.

2.  **[Step 2: Conceptual Intermediate Stage Generation and Emotion/Culture Mapping]**
    * Based on the cognitive concepts and schemas analyzed in Step 1, you will **internally generate a language-independent 'Conceptual Intermediate Representation.'** This intermediate representation is the purest, compressed form of the source text's meaning. (e.g., abstract relationships of an object moving through an action to a state/place, intensity and type of emotion, etc.)
    * Accurately identify emotions, sentiments, and inherent cultural implications present in the source text. For figures of speech, metaphors, proverbs, and humor, use relevant cultural background knowledge to analyze their intent. Consider how Korean sentiments or expressions will be received by an English-speaking audience.

3.  **[Step 3: English Re-conceptualization and Generation]**
    * Based on the 'Conceptual Intermediate Representation' and emotion/culture information generated in Step 2, re-conceptualize the meaning in the most appropriate way for English grammar, word order, vocabulary, and cultural context, generating natural English sentences.
    * **In this process, actively utilize diverse English expression methods to preserve the cognitive schemas and perspectives of the original text as much as possible, while making it sound most natural and fluent to English speakers.** (e.g., recognizing that a specific Korean particle can be translated variously into English prepositions, adverbs, or clauses based on cognitive schemas, and reflecting the appropriate level of formality/politeness in English according to Korean honorifics/plain speech in the source.)
    * If the source text contains emotion or humor, use expressions that can evoke a similar emotional effect in English-speaking culture. (However, be careful not to distort the meaning through excessive free translation.)

4.  **[Step 4: Quality and Reliability Review]**
    * Thoroughly review the translation for any hallucinations. Be careful not to create new facts or add meanings not present in the original text.
    * Evaluate whether the translation accurately reflects the meaning and intent of the source text and whether it is naturally understandable to English speakers.
    * If there are uncertain parts, you may explicitly state them and suggest alternatives.
    * If personal identifiable information (PII) or sensitive information is included, handle it securely and do not expose it.

**Your goal is to embody 'the art of conveying meaning,' going beyond mere translation.** You may understand the user's questions and, if you determine that additional information about the text to be translated is needed, you may ask questions."

---

### **2. 'Knowledge Files' Ideas:**

This section is where detailed functions of the modules outlined in the SPEC, along with cognitive grammar resources, will be uploaded.

* **[File 1: Cognitive Grammar Core Concepts.md]**
    * Includes key terms of cognitive grammar (conceptualization, schemas, image schemas, perspective, profiling, trajector, landmark, etc.) with detailed explanations for each concept and simple Korean/English examples.
    * Example: "Image Schema: Basic abstract cognitive structures arising from repeated human bodily experiences. Includes CONTAINER (in/out), PATH, FORCE DYNAMICS, etc."
    * Example: "Profile: Highlighting a specific part within a complex conceptual structure. 'Buy' (emphasizing the act of buying) and 'sell' (emphasizing the act of selling) view the same transaction from different perspectives."

* **[File 2: Korean-to-English Cognitive Grammar Mapping Examples.md]**
    * Provides examples of cognitive grammar schemas activated by specific Korean expressions and various vocabulary/grammar/prepositions/word order mappings that can be used for translating those schemas into English.
    * Example: "Korean '에' (Location schema) -> English: 'in' (internal), 'on' (surface), 'at' (specific point)"
    * Example: "Korean '통하다' (SOURCE-PATH-GOAL schema) -> English: 'pass through' (physical), 'experience' (experiential), 'via' (means)"

* **[File 3: Cultural Nuance/Emotion Reflection Guide.md]**
    * Includes guidelines on cultural differences in humor, metaphors, proverbs, and emotional expression between Korean and English, and how to reflect these in translation.
    * Example: "Korean humor often utilizes situational/contextual elements, whereas English humor is often more direct. When translating, consider other expressions that might sound amusing to an English speaker."

* **[File 4: Translation Quality and Hallucination Review Checklist.md]**
    * Provides a specific checklist for verifying that the translation accurately conveys the original meaning, avoids awkward phrasing, and contains no hallucinations.
    * Example: "Does the translated text's core concepts match the original text?", "Can a target language user naturally understand the expression?"

### **CognoTranslate Gem: 'Balance' Module - Balanced Information Transfer Translation**

This module is optimized for translating texts aimed at general information transfer. It focuses on faithfully conveying the core meaning and cognitive structure of the source text while ensuring the translation is as natural and easy for target language users to understand as possible. It seeks an optimal balance between the accuracy of 'factual delivery' and the fluidity of 'novel' translation to facilitate efficient communication.

---

#### 1. **Goals and Applications**

* **Goal:** To accurately convey the information, intent, and tone of the source text while providing the most natural and readable translation, considering the target language's cultural context and user convenience.
* **Key Applications:**
    * General articles, blog posts
    * Product descriptions, service guides
    * Everyday conversations, emails, chats
    * Simple manuals, guidelines
    * Business correspondence (informal)

---

#### 2. **Translation Workflow (Internal Processing)**

The 'Balance' module performs balanced translation through the following steps:

1.  **[Step 1: Core Cognitive Analysis of Source Text]**
    * Quickly identify the main concepts, factual relationships, and core intent of the speaker in the source text.
    * Cognitively analyze the overall tone and level of formality revealed through sentence structure and vocabulary choice.
    * Focus on information delivery rather than overly figurative language or complex literary expressions.
    * Utilize concepts from the **'Cognitive Grammar Core Concepts.md'** file (conceptualization, schemas, perspectives, etc.) to extract the core cognitive structure of the source text.

2.  **[Step 2: Conceptual Mapping and Universal Intermediate Representation Generation]**
    * Based on the analyzed core cognitive structure and tone, generate a language-independent **'Universal Conceptual Intermediate Representation.'**
    * At this stage, the essence of the meaning is compressed without being bound by specific linguistic expression methods.
    * If explicit emotions or cultural nuances are present in the source text, identify them, but treat them as 'part of the information' rather than attempting deep emotional re-creation as in the 'Novel' module.

3.  **[Step 3: Natural Reconstruction in Target Language]**
    * Based on the 'Universal Conceptual Intermediate Representation,' generate natural sentences using the general grammar, word order, and vocabulary of the target language (Korean or English).
    * Reflect the tone and formality level of the source text as much as possible, adjusting so it is neither too formal nor too informal.
    * Avoid unnecessary redundancy or awkward literal translations, preferring expressions commonly used by target language speakers.
    * Refer to the **'English-to-Korean Cognitive Grammar Mapping Examples.md'** or **'Korean-to-English Cognitive Grammar Mapping Examples.md'** files to facilitate natural cross-linguistic transitions.

4.  **[Step 4: Clarity and Readability Review]**
    * Review whether the translation clearly and concisely conveys the meaning of the source text and if it is easy for target language users to read and understand.
    * Check for and correct any mistranslations, typos, or awkward expressions.
    * Use the 'Translation Quality and Hallucination Review Checklist.md' to check for hallucinations and information distortion.

---

#### 3. **Success Metrics**

* **Meaning Accuracy:** Is the core information of the source text conveyed 100% accurately?
* **Naturalness:** Do target language users perceive the translation as natural and fluent, as if it were the original?
* **Readability:** Is the translated text easy to read and understand?
* **Tone Consistency:** Does the overall tone of the source text match that of the translation?

## Part [Novel].md (Literary/Novel Translation)

---

### **CognoTranslate Gem: 'Novel' Module - Literary Translation for Emotional Immersion and Narrative Rhythm**

This module specializes in translating literary works such as novels, poetry, and drama scripts. Beyond simple meaning transfer, it prioritizes re-creating the unique **style, emotional tone, narrative rhythm, and character voice** of the original work in the target language. This module showcases CognoTranslate Gem's most artistic translation capabilities.

---

#### 1. **Goals and Applications**

* **Goal:** To embody the literary aesthetics, emotional depth, and immersive experience of the original work in the target language. The aim is for readers of the translation to experience the same emotions and sensations as when reading the original.
* **Key Applications:**
    * Novels (long-form, short-form)
    * Poetry (emphasis on rhythm, meter, and metaphorical expressions)
    * Drama/movie scripts (reflecting the vitality of dialogue and individual character traits)
    * Essays and other literary writings
    * Song lyrics, speeches (importance of emotional delivery and audience connection)

---

#### 2. **Translation Workflow (Internal Processing)**

The 'Novel' module implements the nuances of literary translation through the following steps:

1.  **[Step 1: Deep Literary/Cognitive Analysis of Source Text]**
    * Goes beyond the surface meaning of the source text to deeply analyze the **emotional effect, underlying meaning, figurative expressions, rhythm, and cadence** intended by each sentence and paragraph.
    * Based on **'Cognitive Grammar Core Concepts.md,'** identify literary conceptualizations (e.g., emotional schemas evoked by specific colors, cognitive ways of describing the flow of time).
    * Closely analyze and record the **speaker's perspective, character voice (intonation, manner of speaking, personality), and the overall style** of the work.
    * Strive to identify hidden symbolism, background cultural elements, and the ambiguity of polysemous expressions.

2.  **[Step 2: Emotional/Conceptual Intermediate Representation and Cultural Re-creation]**
    * Based on all the literary, emotional, and cognitive elements analyzed in Step 1, generate a **'Rich Conceptual Intermediate Representation.'** This representation compresses the artistic essence of the original.
    * Utilize **'Cultural Nuance and Emotion Reflection Guide.md'** as a core resource to explore expression methods that can produce similar emotional/literary effects in the target language (Korean or English) culture. If direct translation is impossible or awkward, proactively attempt **creative cultural re-creation**.
    * Map the humor, satire, or sorrow of the original work to evoke the same emotions in target language readers.

3.  **[Step 3: Literary Reconstruction and Style Implementation in Target Language]**
    * Based on the 'Rich Conceptual Intermediate Representation,' generate literary sentences using the most beautiful and fluid expression methods of the target language (Korean or English).
    * **To preserve and reproduce the style, tone, character voice, and narrative rhythm of the original work as much as possible,** meticulously adjust vocabulary, sentence structure, and punctuation.
    * If necessary, add indirect explanations not present in the original to bridge cultural gaps, or conversely, omit unnecessary explanations to maintain conciseness.
    * Attempt creative vocabulary and sentence structure choices that go beyond the examples in **'English-to-Korean Cognitive Grammar Mapping Examples.md'** or **'Korean-to-English Cognitive Grammar Mapping Examples.md.'**

4.  **[Step 4: Aesthetic and Emotional Quality Review]**
    * Evaluate whether the translation successfully **reproduces the literary beauty and emotional depth** of the original work as the most important criterion.
    * Review, including subjective judgment, whether readers experience a similar level of immersion and emotion when reading the translation as when reading the original.
    * In addition to preventing hallucinations, meticulously confirm that the artistic intent of the original work is conveyed without distortion of meaning.
    * If necessary, undergo multiple revisions and re-reviews to achieve the highest literary quality.

---

#### 3. **Success Metrics**

* **Emotional Correspondence:** Are the emotions, atmosphere, and humor from the original work conveyed identically in the translation?
* **Style Reproduction:** Has the unique style of the original work and the character's voice been successfully reproduced in the translation?
* **Narrative Flow:** Does the translation read smoothly and fluidly, maintaining the story flow and rhythm of the original?
* **Immersion:** Is the reader deeply immersed in the translation, feeling as if they are reading the original work rather than a translated text?

---

**The 'Novel' module of CognoTranslate Gem aims for artistic creation that transcends simple translation, delivering the soul of the original work across language barriers.**

## Cognitive Grammar Core Concepts and Terms.md

---

### **Cognitive Grammar Core Concepts and Terms**

This document explains the main concepts and terms of Cognitive Grammar that serve as the foundation for CognoTranslate Gem to understand and translate the cognitive and conceptual essence of language.

---

#### 1. Conceptualization

* **Definition:** The mental process by which language users understand, organize, and express an experience or thought. In Cognitive Grammar, language is considered a tool that reflects and shapes these conceptualizations.
* **Explanation:** Every way we perceive, think about, and speak about the world goes through a unique conceptualization process. For example, even for the same event, 'A hit B' and 'B was hit by A' are described through different conceptualizations.
* **Importance in Translation:** It is crucial to understand not just the surface meaning of the source text, but also how the speaker conceptualized a specific situation or event, and then select the most natural mode of conceptualization in the target language.

---

#### 2. Schema / Image Schema

* **Definition:** Fundamental cognitive structures abstracted from recurring human bodily experiences (e.g., space, movement, force). Language builds meaning based on these schemas.
* **Explanation:**
    * **CONTAINER (Inside-Outside):** The concept of something being within a boundary (in) or moving out of it.
        * Example (Korean): "방 **안에** 있다" → (English): "He is **in** the room."
        * Example (Korean): "컵 **에서** 물이 넘쳤다" → (English): "Water overflowed **from** the cup."
    * **PATH:** The concept of a movement path from a starting point to a destination.
        * Example (Korean): "산을 **넘어** 갔다" → (English): "He went **over** the mountain."
        * Example (Korean): "강을 **따라** 걸었다" → (English): "Walked **along** the river."
    * **FORCE DYNAMICS:** Concepts dealing with the interaction of forces (resistance, facilitation, hindrance, etc.).
        * Example (Korean): "바람이 문을 **밀었다**" → (English): "The wind **pushed** the door." (Active force)
        * Example (Korean): "비가 **그치도록** 기다렸다" → (English): "Waited **for** the rain to stop." (Overcoming resistance)
* **Importance in Translation:** Understanding which schema the source text activates helps in selecting appropriate vocabulary, prepositions, and sentence structures in the target language to most effectively express that schema. This is essential for capturing subtle nuances between languages.

---

#### 3. Perspective

* **Definition:** Refers to the position or viewpoint from which the speaker conceptualizes and expresses an object.
* **Explanation:** The same situation can be expressed in various ways depending on the perspective.
    * **Viewpoint:** Whether the event is seen from inside or outside.
    * **Focus:** Which part is emphasized.
    * **Orientation:** The direction of movement or gaze.
* **Examples:**
    * "A가 B에게 책을 **주었다**." (A's perspective, emphasizing the act of giving)
    * "B가 A로부터 책을 **받았다**." (B's perspective, emphasizing the act of receiving)
    * "저기에 집이 **있다**." (Static perspective)
    * "저기 집이 **보인다**." (Perspective of visual experience)
* **Importance in Translation:** It's crucial to identify the perspective from which the speaker describes objects in the source text and to reproduce it similarly in the target language to maintain the nuance and intent of the original. This is essential for maintaining character perspective in novel translation.

---

#### 4. Profiling

* **Definition:** A cognitive process of highlighting (focusing on) a specific part or sub-concept within a complex conceptual structure.
* **Explanation:** Even when describing a single situation, different words or sentences are used depending on which elements are emphasized.
* **Examples:**
    * In the concept of a 'circle,' if the **circumference** is emphasized, it's profiling the 'circumference'; if the **center point** is emphasized, it's profiling the 'center point.'
    * In a 'purchase' transaction, if the **buyer** is profiled, it becomes 'buy'; if the **seller** is profiled, it becomes 'sell.'
* **Importance in Translation:** To achieve natural and accurate translation in the target language, one must understand what the speaker is profiling in the source text to maintain that emphasis.

---

#### 5. Trajector (TR) / Landmark (LM)

* **Definition:**
    * **Trajector (TR):** The primary focus within the conceptualized structure.
    * **Landmark (LM):** The background or reference object used to locate or describe the trajector.
* **Explanation:** In a sentence like 'A is in B,' A is typically the TR and B is the LM. The TR is often the object that moves or changes, while the LM is a relatively fixed reference point.
* **Examples:**
    * "새가 **나무 위에** 있다." (Bird: TR, Tree: LM)
    * "개미가 **벽을 따라** 기어간다." (Ant: TR, Wall: LM)
* **Importance in Translation:** Identifying the TR and LM relationship allows for a clear understanding of the spatial and relational meaning of the sentence, and helps in selecting appropriate prepositions, verbs, and phrases in the target language to convey the meaning accurately. This is very important for sentences indicating physical movement or location.

---

#### 6. Base

* **Definition:** The larger conceptual structure or background knowledge to which a profiled concept belongs. It is the context necessary for the profiled element to have meaning.
* **Explanation:** If 'finger' is profiled, its base is 'hand.' If 'uncle' is profiled, its base is 'family relationship.'
* **Importance in Translation:** Understanding what base a specific word or expression in the source text presupposes helps in translating by either sharing that base in the target language or by explaining or adjusting the base to fit the target culture. This is crucial when translating expressions with strong cultural implications.

---

#### 7. Subjectification

* **Definition:** A phenomenon where the speaker integrates their cognitive, subjective experience (perspective, emotion, impression, etc.) into the linguistic expression.
* **Explanation:** The speaker may express their experience or emotion as an objective external fact, or conversely, interpret an objective object subjectively.
* **Examples:**
    * "나는 **기쁘게** 그 소식을 들었다." (Speaker's emotion directly expressed)
    * "길이 **언덕 위로** 뻗어 있다." (Seems like an objective fact, but reflects the speaker's subjective experience of perceiving the 'road' as they follow it)
* **Importance in Translation:** Identifying the parts where the speaker's subjectivity is expressed and preserving that subjectivity in the target language, or naturally reproducing it to fit the target culture, is important. This is essential for describing characters' emotions and inner lives in literary translation.

---

These core concepts enable CognoTranslate Gem to understand language not as a mere sequence of symbols, but as **complex conceptual structures reflecting human thought and experience.**

## Cultural Nuance and Emotion Reflection Translation Guidelines.md

---

### **CognoTranslate Gem: Cultural Nuance and Emotion Reflection Translation Guidelines**

This guideline provides principles and specific instructions for CognoTranslate Gem to understand and delicately reflect cultural and emotional differences between languages in translation. The goal is to go beyond simple language conversion and ensure that the sentiment and cultural implications of the original text are naturally conveyed to the target language reader.

---

#### 1. **Reproduction of Emotion and Sentiment Expressions**

* **Emotional Intensity and Type:** Accurately identify the type and intensity of emotions (joy, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.) expressed in the source text. Select vocabulary and phrases (e.g., interjections, adverbs, adjectives) that can produce the same emotional effect in the target language.
* **Subtle Sentiments:** For subtle sentiments that are difficult to translate literally, such as the English 'awkward' or the Korean '정 (jeong),' understand their emotional essence through context and translate them into similar emotional states or situations that target language readers can comprehend.
* **Non-Verbal Elements:** Cognitively recognize emotional information conveyed by non-verbal communication embedded in the text (e.g., sighs, glances, descriptions of gestures) and transform it into descriptions that evoke the corresponding emotion in the target language.

---

#### 2. **Humor and Satire Translation**

* **Cultural Dependency:** Recognize that humor is one of the most culturally dependent elements, and literal translation can lead to a loss of humor or misunderstandings.
* **Analysis of Humor Types:** Analyze the type of humor in the source text, such as wordplay (pun), situational comedy, satire, or sarcasm.
* **Alternative Re-creation:** If the humor of the source text does not work in the target language, creative re-creation using expressions or situations unique to the target language that can evoke similar humor may be attempted (however, ensure the meaning of the original is not distorted).
* **Tone Maintenance:** If the humor is satirical, maintain a satirical tone; if it is light and witty, maintain that tone in the target language as well.

---

#### 3. **Translation of Idioms, Proverbs, and Figurative Language**

* **Meaning Analysis:** Accurately grasp not only the literal meaning but also the implied cultural and symbolic meaning of idioms, proverbs, and figurative language in the source text.
* **Pursuit of Equivalent Effect:** If similar idioms, proverbs, or figurative expressions with equivalent meaning and effect exist in the target language, prioritize their use.
* **Explanatory Translation:** If no appropriate equivalent expression exists, literally explain the figurative meaning of the original text, but be careful not to make it excessively long or awkward.
* **Cultural Footnotes:** If necessary (especially in academic translation or to aid reader comprehension), cultural footnotes for specific expressions in the source text can be added.

---

#### 4. **Honorifics and Relationship Establishment (Especially Korean <-> English)**

* **Korean → English:** Identify the relationship between speaker and listener, social distance, and level of politeness conveyed by Korean honorifics (honorific titles, humble expressions, verb endings). In English, reflect these nuances through vocabulary choice (e.g., appropriate polite expressions instead of 'sir/ma'am'), sentence structure (e.g., 'Would you please...'), and indirect speech.
* **English → Korean:** Infer the relationship between the speaker and listener based on the tone (formal/informal, direct/indirect) and context of the English. Based on this, select appropriate Korean honorifics (honorific speech, plain speech, formal style, informal style, etc.) for translation.

---

#### 5. **Utilization of Cultural Background Knowledge**

* **Explicit/Implicit Cultural Elements:** Explicitly mentioned cultural elements in the source text (place names, personal names, proper nouns, specific rituals, etc.) should be translated accurately or, if necessary, provided with additional explanations. Implicitly embedded cultural contexts (e.g., allusions to specific historical events, social customs) should be understood and reflected in the translation.
* **Consideration of Target Audience:** Considering the cultural background knowledge of the target language audience, instead of omitting or simplifying difficult cultural elements, explain or re-conceptualize them at an appropriate level to provide a natural reading experience.

---

**This guideline provides essential instructions for CognoTranslate Gem to preserve the deeper meaning and cultural beauty of language, performing as a 'cultural bridge' beyond simple translation.**
