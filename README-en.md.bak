# CognoTranslate Gem: A Cognition-Based Korean Translation Agent

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**CognoTranslate Gem** is an advanced cognition-based translation agent that goes beyond simple language conversion. It deeply understands the **cognitive and conceptual essence** of the source text and **re-conceptualizes** it into the most natural and rich Korean. This project actively integrates the principles of **Cognitive Grammar** into the translation process, aiming to meticulously reflect subtle nuances and cultural contexts between languages.

While traditional translation systems have been limited to superficial word-for-word or sentence-for-sentence conversion, CognoTranslate Gem seeks to elevate translation from a mere function to an **'art of meaning conveyance'** by mimicking how humans think and how language constructs concepts.

**This project was developed within the Google Gemini Gems environment, specifically utilizing the Gemini 2.5 Flash model to confirm the astonishing potential of cognition-based translation and achieve meaningful results.**

## ✨ Key Features and Characteristics

* **Cognitive Grammar-Based Deep Analysis:** Beyond the superficial meaning of the English source text, it profoundly grasps the **conceptual schemata (Image Schema)**, speaker's **perspective**, and **conceptualization method** embedded within sentences.
* **Language-Independent Conceptual Intermediate Representation Generation:** Based on the analyzed cognitive concepts, it internally generates a **'conceptual intermediate representation'** independent of language, compressing the pure essence of the source meaning.
* **Cultural Nuance and Emotion Mapping:** It accurately identifies emotions, sentiments, metaphors, humor, and other **cultural implications** present in the source text and maps them to be most appropriately reproduced in Korean culture.
* **Natural Re-conceptualization in Korean:** It preserves the cognitive schemata and perspectives of the original text while generating the most **natural and elegant Korean sentences** tailored to Korean grammar, word order, vocabulary, and cultural context. Especially for literary translation like novels, it prioritizes emotional immersion and narrative rhythm.
* **Advanced Quality and Reliability Review:**
    * **Hallucination detection** and correction prevent the generation of information not present in the source text.
    * A **translation quality improvement loop** self-validates and refines the accuracy and naturalness of translations.
    * Strict adherence to the latest security and ethical regulations such as **GDPR, AI Act 2025, and OWASP AI Top 10** ensures safe and reliable translation.
    * **Whether the translated expression is naturally understandable by the user** serves as a core review criterion.

## 🛠️ Translation Workflow (Internal Processing)

1.  **[Step 1: Cognitive Analysis of Source Text]**
    * Tokenizes the English source text and identifies parts of speech and syntactic structures.
    * Extracts core meaning, speaker's intent, and contextual nuances, with a special focus on Cognitive Grammar principles like image schemata, perspective, conceptualization methods, and emotions.
2.  **[Step 2: Conceptual Intermediate Stage Generation & Emotion/Culture Mapping]**
    * Integrates the cognitive concepts analyzed in Step 1 to internally structure a language-independent 'conceptual intermediate representation'.
    * Identifies emotions, sentiments, and cultural implications of the source text and explores ways to reproduce them appropriately for Korean culture.
3.  **[Step 3: Korean Re-conceptualization & Sentence Generation]**
    * Based on the 'conceptual intermediate representation' and emotion/culture information, it re-conceptualizes and generates the final Korean sentences in the most appropriate and natural way, considering Korean grammar, word order, vocabulary, and cultural context.
    * Actively utilizes Korean features such as subject omission, flexible word order, use of particles and endings, and honorifics/non-honorifics to create elegant sentences.
4.  **[Step 4: Quality & Compliance Review]**
    * Thoroughly reviews and corrects hallucinations, semantic distortions, and omissions.
    * Ensures compliance with privacy protection and ethical regulations to guarantee safe and reliable output.

## **How to Create and Use This Gem in Gemini Gems (Novel Translation Specific)**

To implement and use `CognoTranslate Gem v0.1` (specialized for novel translation) in the Gemini Gems environment, follow these steps:

1.  **Access Gemini Gems:**
    Navigate to the Gemini interface where you can create or manage custom Gems.

2.  **Create a New Gem:**
    Find options like "Create Gem" or "Build My Own Gem" and start creating a new Gem.

3.  **Define Gem Instructions:**
    * Copy the **entire content of the `파트 [소설].md` file**. This content will serve as the core instructions for this Gem to function as a **specialized literary (novel, poetry, etc.) translation agent**.
    * Paste this content into the designated **"Instructions"** or **"Prompt"** input field of your new Gem.

4.  **Upload Knowledge Files:**
    * Locate the area in the Gemini Gems interface where you can upload files. Generally, **up to 10 files can be uploaded**.
    * Upload all **4 of the following `.md` files**. These files will be used by the Gem to reference in-depth grammatical, cultural, and quality control knowledge necessary for novel translation:
        * `인지 문법 핵심 개념 및 용어.md` (Core Concepts and Terms in Cognitive Grammar.md)
        * `한국어-영어 인지 문법 매핑 예시.md` (Korean-English Cognitive Grammar Mapping Examples.md)
        * `문화적 뉘앙스 및 감정 반영 번역 가이드라인.md` (Cultural Nuances and Emotion Reflection Translation Guidelines.md)
        * `번역 품질 및 할루시네이션 검토 체크리스트.md` (Translation Quality and Hallucination Review Checklist.md)

5.  **Test the Gem:**
    After completing all settings, thoroughly test the Gem with various Korean novels or literary texts. You can verify if the Gem correctly applies the configured workflow and knowledge to produce rich, literary translations.
