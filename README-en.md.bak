# CognoTranslate Gem: A Cognitive-Based Korean Translation Agent

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

**CognoTranslate Gem** goes beyond mere language conversion. It's an advanced cognitive-based translation agent designed to deeply understand the **cognitive and conceptual essence** of source texts and **re-conceptualize** them into the target language (Korean) in the most natural and rich way. This project aims to meticulously reflect subtle linguistic nuances and cultural contexts by actively integrating the principles of Cognitive Grammar into the translation process.

While existing translation systems have often been limited to surface-level word-for-word or sentence-for-sentence conversion, CognoTranslate Gem seeks to mimic human thought processes and how language constructs concepts, elevating translation from a simple function to **'the art of conveying meaning.'**

**This project was developed within the Google Gemini Gems environment, and we have achieved significant results, confirming the remarkable potential of cognitive-based translation, particularly by leveraging the Gemini 2.5 Flash model.**

## ‚ú® Key Features & Characteristics

* **Deep Analysis Based on Cognitive Grammar:** Goes beyond the surface meaning of English source texts to deeply grasp **conceptual schemas (Image Schemas)**, the speaker's **perspective**, and **modes of conceptualization** embedded within sentences.
* **Language-Independent Conceptual Intermediate Representation Generation:** Based on the analyzed cognitive concepts, it internally generates a language-independent **'Conceptual Intermediate Representation,'** which compresses the source text's meaning into its purest form.
* **Cultural Nuance and Emotion Mapping:** Accurately identifies emotions, sentiments, metaphors, humor, and other **cultural implications** revealed in the source text, mapping them to be most appropriately reproduced in Korean culture.
* **Natural Korean Re-conceptualization:** Generates natural and elegant Korean sentences that align with Korean grammar, word order, vocabulary, and cultural context, while preserving the cognitive schemas and perspectives of the original text. For literary translation, it prioritizes emotional immersion and narrative rhythm.
* **Advanced Quality and Reliability Review:**
    * **Hallucination detection** and correction features prevent the generation of information not present in the original text.
    * A **translation quality improvement loop** self-verifies and enhances the accuracy and naturalness of translations.
    * Strictly adheres to the latest security and ethical regulations such as **GDPR, AI Act 2025, and OWASP AI Top 10**, ensuring secure and reliable translations.
    * **The ability of target language users to naturally understand the expression** is a core review criterion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Translation Workflow (Internal Processing)

1.  **[Step 1: Source Text Cognitive Analysis]**
    * Analyzes the English source text at the token level, identifying parts of speech and syntactic structures.
    * Extracts core meaning, speaker's intent, and contextual nuances, with a special focus on identifying cognitive grammar elements such as conceptual schemas, perspectives, modes of conceptualization, and emotions.
2.  **[Step 2: Conceptual Intermediate Stage Generation and Emotion/Culture Mapping]**
    * Integrates the cognitive concepts analyzed in Step 1 to internally structure a language-independent 'Conceptual Intermediate Representation.'
    * Identifies emotions, sentiments, and cultural implications in the source text and explores how to reproduce them appropriately in Korean culture.
3.  **[Step 3: Korean Re-conceptualization and Sentence Generation]**
    * Based on the 'Conceptual Intermediate Representation' and emotion/culture information, it re-conceptualizes and generates the final Korean sentence in the most appropriate and natural way for Korean grammar, word order, vocabulary, and cultural context.
    * Actively utilizes Korean characteristics such as subject omission, flexible word order, the use of particles and verb endings, and honorifics/plain speech to create elegant sentences.
4.  **[Step 4: Quality and Compliance Review]**
    * Thoroughly reviews and corrects any hallucinations, meaning distortions, or information omissions.
    * Verifies compliance with personal information protection and ethical regulations to ensure secure and reliable results.
